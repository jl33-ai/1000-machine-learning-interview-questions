# How this Book Works

This book is designed to be ***fun and efficient.*** 

```python

├── Act I (first major topic or unit)

It is non-linear: (show each textbook as a node in a graph) and like a green yes/ No

### Question Difficulty

*All interview-style questions, with only **3 tiers** of difficulty.* 

Within each section the questions get progressively harder, or sections may be explicitly separated into difficulty level. 

We have tried hard to make the questions as close-ended as possible, because open-ended questions are annoying and unhelpful. 

⍰ **Easy/Hard questions** target the concepts and theory. 
☞ "What is `2+2`?"
☞ "How do you understand feature importance in multivariate regression?"

⍰ **Case studies** are open-ended, hypothetical-situation, application-based questions and require high technical fluency. For example: 
☞ "Whats the most fun way to make a snake game" *(Jane Street, Final Interview)*
☞ "How would you go about predicting churn for XYZ" *(Atlassian, Final Interview)*
**Some are hypothetical, some are real-world case studies.**

### Structure of a Question

###### This is an example question.
If the question is too long, it may overflow underneath. Questions can link to [[1 How this book works#^7e0f00|other questions]] as well.

The answer goes here. 

<br>
###### ↳ This is a follow up question
> ⚘ This is a helpful definition

☞ This will guide you through an **answer**...
∴ And reach a **conclusion**.

# Your Knowledge Level

This book covers everything, but that doesn't mean you have to cover everything. 

It works **independently** of your level of knowledge... 
☞ If you know nothing, you learn from the answers, 
☞ If you know everything, you'll get practice from the questions. 

You'll see what I mean. 

The book is very **loosely** structured into only THREE main sections. Just read it from the start, in a linear fashion, and see how far you get. Questions are assorted. They will tend to get more niche, specialised and difficult. There are brain teasers sprinkled throughout. more of a repository than a textbook; but it works if you read it top to bottom. It's inherently non linear; an non-directed graph, as you can see. Jump around from topic to topic and slowly fill in the gaps. If you have enough knowledge to read it linearly, you probably hold 3 different PhD's. I have used tags and structuring to allow you to hop between different topics. Questions are designed to be MECE

# How to Read

- How would you feel if Python only executed 60% of your code? 
- All unnecessary noise, cleaned away (sketch)
- technically the book is self contained... you can... 
- think of scary the word 'cardiovascular' looked the first time you read it. Simple logic hides behind all the scary words in this book. It's called Jargon. 
- Understanding > Memorising > Reading 
- Look say cover write check. Just because you read the answer $\implies$ doesn't mean you will answer it in an interview. 
-  in your own words - or even just reading from the answers. Your interview **cannot** be the first time you've ever tried to articulate these concepts aloud. 

Follow the pointers ☞ (not `C`).

# Philosophies of this Book

##### 1) The philosophy of this book is to explain things in plain english.

Quality does not increase with quantity of fancy words. 


![[fancy jargon.svg | 500]]


- Furthermore, most resources only tell you '**about**' models. 
- They don't really work through the exact mechanics of **how they work**
	- and the ones that do, are so math-dense that they're basically unreadable. 

##### 2) I've always believed **asking** is better than **telling**; that's why this book is structured as an interview instead of an informatory textbook.
