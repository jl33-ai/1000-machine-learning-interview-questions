(Pretty picture of NeetCode)

As companies try to level the playing field for penultimate-year students who may not have even touched a statistics textbook yet, they need a more standardised way to measure aptitude. 

This often comes in the form of general math, statistics, and probability questions, as well as programming skills and algorithmic thinking, the latter of which we will cover in this section.

***C++ for just knowing another language and it's pretty and for programming whereas python is for scripting.***

### Your Leetcode Roadmap

![[leet-hacker.svg | 500]]


look art it, read t, then: monotonic stack, dfs, 
Neetcode but for ML and with better time complexity and with better concept coverage. 
NeetcodeML 
- Custom Leetcodes written for ML
- 'Check whether there's Nulls'
- 'Train a dataset on this.. and '


### Why doing Leetcodes is worth it

Places tend to test algorithmic intuition since ML is more content-based, and applicants are younger. 

Machine learning algorithms aim to most **effectively** exploit the features of the data, and patterns, in order to yield the most accurate output. 

Normal algorithms aim to most **efficiently** exploit the features of the data. E.g Binary Search exploits the fact that the data is sorted. 


***It uses the same muscles in your brain, leetcodes WILL make you better at machine learning***
- understanding the concepts
- you will have a huge edge 
- Algorithmic skills are assumed at this point.

Be harsh on yourself in training: 
- Practice everything performant; how you type, explain


Hospools, all from DOA (the schedulign one)

every intresting algorithm you should know - for quant, ML... 

follows neetcode. 

I like using C++ cos a) it's just another language, other than the millions who know python b) it's fun as FUCK c) it forces you to slow down (good for learning algorithms) and think about the implications of what you're writing on the machine; closer to low level, machine code. Closer to the Truth of what you're really programming. 

Sometimes it's nice to take a break from the probabilistic nature of machine learning algorithms and focus on some more methodical, determinist algorithms. This is the nature of this section. It will cover the programming fluency and algorithmic thinking which **any data scientist** should possess. 

Most MLE roles will involve some leetcode style questions

Leetcode is obviously about cracking the algorithm -> and then implementing in whatever language you choose. 

Takes you through all common data structures and algorithms, as well as algorithmic paradigms
- DFS
- BFS
- Dynamic Programming

Use pen and paper 

Use the test cases !!!. no ego
holy shit when you can copy the test cases in and gah I'm so dumb. Notice things. 

<p align='center'>Bite Sized Leetcodes to practice Algorithmic Thinking</p>

the toolkit:
- dp
- stack
- dsliding window 
- divide conquer 
- dict/set (hash map)
- dfs
- bfs
- 
- recursion (maybe)

# Practical Leetcode Advice (for the average person)

### ***Puzzles, not code***

This shift in mindset may take you far. 

Leetcodes are more puzzles than code to be written. If you get too caught up with the fact that you need to write code, you will probably struggle.

This is because most Leetcodes require some purely logical observation to be made first, which are completely separate to the way the code is written. 

### ***Where's your Leetcode notebook?***

If you don't have one already, make one. You will immediately notice an improvement in how enjoyable Leetcodes become, as well as how quickly you get them. 

![[leetcode-notebook.svg|400]]


- You may find roughly handwriting psuedocode to be as intuitive as doing math by pen and paper, instead of typing. 

### ***Leetcodes can be addictive if you let them***

Don't stress. Just enjoy the thrill of seeing how this impossible task is done

***Engage your Visual Cortex***
- Use pen and paper


I don't know why this one is overlooked so often. 
I thought I was bad at Leetcodes - I was - but I was A LOT better at them with pen and paper. 
Visual cortex unlocks insights

(For more rich mental embeddings)


+ Video tutorials can be very good

### ***Check the constraints first***

(That section at the bottom)
It's so easy, and will make you look like a **pro**


### ***Redo the ones you did a few weeks ago.***

It is a healthy balance of 1. exposure and 2. repetition. 

Yes everyone just wants to wsee that number tick up. 
But at some point the input/value curve slows down....
you actually get much more from redo'ing leetcodes: you can actually redo them, and better. 
At a certain point you get more out of repeating old ones than doing new ones. 
That said, increasing your breadth truly matters if you memorise the method each time, as it gives you better odds in the interview. 

Omg I fucking get it. Normally you stop oince you JUST get it and move on. But if you go back to it. You get it in such a way that you're like wait how did I ever not get this. 
![[redo-leets.svg| 450]]

---

Algorithms can be rote-learning. At first, the number of things they can test you on seems unlimited, but as you cover more ground, you realise that it is actually quite limited. You'll get better at.

### ***Just sit and think; don't check the answers.***

It's not really about getting the answer right, as it is sitting there and thinking about the answer. 

Get comfy, play some calming [classical music](), and just enjoy the puzzle solving process, enjoy the brain teaser. 

### ***Checking the answers.***

It's okay to refer to sample solutions when you start out - it's a great way to learn, but as your ego increases, you will resent checking them even more. 

If can't figure it out, use the hints provided by Leetcode in the `Description` section: 

![[Pasted image 20231229105115.png | 500]]

If you **really** can't figure it out, don't go straight to the answers, instead, do this: 

```text
Me:
"Can you give me a hint for how to solve this (((WITHOUT GIVING AWAY THE ANSWER))): ... "

ChatGPT:
" ... "
```

<br>

### ***Improving.***

Again, [[#***Redo the ones you did a few weeks ago.***|redo them]]. And unless you're 100% confidence in your solution, you should always be doing this: 

```text
Me: 
"Roast my code: ... "


ChatGPT:
"Ah, the classic "code roast"! Let's examine this piece of code with a critical eye and point out areas for improvement or potential issues:"
```

###### Q1) **Longest Common Prefix**

```
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

EG
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

**Solution**: Sort the array of strings and compare the first and last words from the start; a mismatch between them implies the end of the common prefix - due to lexicographical sorting. 

**Time complexity**

`Total: O(m•n•log(n))`
- **Where** $n$ is the number of words in the list 
- **Where** $n \cdot log(n)$ is the cost of sorting $n$ words
- **Because** $m$ is the maximum number of letters to iterate through (out of the first or last word)

###### Q4) **2-Sum**

---

###### Q5) **3-Sum**
```
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

EG
Input:         nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output:               [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

- **Hint 1)** You have to get it down from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$ 
- **Hint 2)** Exploit the fact that every index $i, j, k$ must be unique 
- **Hint 3)** Sort the list
- **The Idea)**

###### Q7) Travelling Salesman




###### Q8) Palindrome

Problem: `How to find the longest palindrome`
Solution: 



###### Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

I included this one because it's deceptively hard. Seems so trivial but actually tricky to implement in any language (well, for me)

(diagramo of keypad)

**Solution:** There's no clever 'trick', but if you understand the recursive function that's just as impressive. 

- Base cases: 
	- You've gotten a string long enough to 
	- You've reached the end of the 'digits'
- Recursive case: 
	- 
(stack diagram)


```python
def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:

	if digits=="":
		return []
	d = ["", "","abc","def","ghi","jkl","mno","pqrs","tuv","wxyz"]
	n = len(digits)
	output = []
	def addto(i, s):
		if len(s) == n:
			output.append("".join(s))
			return
		if i == n:
			return
		for j in d[int(digits[i])]:
			s.append(j)
			addto(i+1, s)
			s.pop()
		return
	addto(0, [])
	return output
```
