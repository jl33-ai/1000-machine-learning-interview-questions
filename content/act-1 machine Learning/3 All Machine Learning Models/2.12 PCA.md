> [!check] PCA (explanation 1)
> The idea is to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. This is done by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, the principal components, which are uncorrelated and ordered so that the first few retain most of the variation present in all of the original variables

> [!check] PCA (explanation 2)
> PCA is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

> [!check] PCA (explanation 3)
> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that transforms the data into a new coordinate system, such that the greatest variance by any projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.

Steps: 

PCA finds the best fitting line by maximising the sum of squared distances from the projected points to the origin.
