The idea is to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. This is done by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, the principal components, which are uncorrelated and ordered so that the first few retain most of the variation present in all of the original variables.

Steps: 

PCA finds the best fitting line by maximising the sum of squared distances from the projected points to the origin.
