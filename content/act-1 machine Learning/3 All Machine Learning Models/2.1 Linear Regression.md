There have been **entire textbooks** dedicated to this one model. For now, we'll just cover what you need to know to pass the interview.

- L1 Regression (Lasso Regularisation)
- L2 Regression (Ridge Regularisation)

**or Linear Regression:**

- **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This can lead to some coefficients being zero, effectively performing feature selection.
- **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Introduces a penalty term equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. This discourages large values of coefficients but does not set them to zero.
