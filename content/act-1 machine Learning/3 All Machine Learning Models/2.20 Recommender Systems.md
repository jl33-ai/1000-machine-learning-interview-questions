More of an application than a specific model architecture, but commonly asked about enough to warrant their own section,. 

Recommender Systems are not a specific ML model but more a 'class' of ML systems, applied to a very valuable problem: predicting what to recommend to customers

More a class of models, but important enough to warrant its own section.

##### What are the three ways to approach Recommender Systems? 

> [!check] Collaborative Filtering
> - Leverages user/product ratings to make guesses about the similarity of users/products, and recommend products accordingly
> - Can be user-based or item-based

> [!check] Content Based
> - Is based on the intrinsic qualities of content you are recommending (movies, songs, products)
> - E.g, **Spotify** might recommend you songs that sound similar. 

> [!check] Deep Learning Approaches
> - [[(0.1) Fundamentals|Deep learning]] models uncover complex, abstract patterns in user data, revealing nuanced preferences and behaviors.
> - Capable of identifying intricate relationships and hidden features in large datasets, beyond the reach of traditional algorithms.
> - Adapting to both explicit interactions and subtle, implicit user signals.
> - Enhance accuracy and relevance of recommendations by deeply understanding user profiles and item characteristics.

##### Explain the core logic behind item and user based [[2.20 Recommender Systems#What are the three ways to approach Recommender Systems?|collaborative filtering]]

> [!check] Item based
> If items A and B were rated similarly by many users, then they are similar, and therefore someone who likes item A will probably also like item B. 

> [!check] User based
> If users A and B rated items similarly in the past, they will have similar preferences in the future.

##### Understanding Average Precision (AP)

Mean Average Precision (MAP) is a metric used to evaluate the quality of information retrieval systems and ranking algorithms, especially in contexts where the order of the returned items is important. It's often used in tasks like document retrieval, image retrieval, and ranking problems in machine learning.

To understand MAP, you first need to grasp the concept of Average Precision (AP). AP is calculated for each query and is a way to incorporate both precision and recall into a single metric:

- **Precision at k** is the proportion of relevant items among the top k returned items.
- **Recall at k** is the proportion of relevant items found in the top k returned items out of all relevant items.

For a single query, you calculate the precision at every position in the ranked sequence of items and then average these precision values. More specifically, you do this at every position where a relevant item is found. This method highlights the importance of the ranking of the relevant items - the higher they are ranked, the better the precision score.

### Calculating Mean Average Precision

MAP extends the idea of AP to a set of queries (searches). It is the mean of the Average Precision scores for each query. Here's how it's generally calculated:

1. **For each query**: 
   - Compute the precision at each rank in the list of retrieved items.
   - Calculate the AP by taking the average of these precision values at each rank where a relevant item is found.

2. **For the dataset**: 
   - Calculate the mean of these AP scores over all queries to get MAP.

### Formula

If we have \( Q \) queries, and for each query \( q \), \( n_q \) is the number of retrieved items, and \( P(k, q) \) is the precision at cut-off \( k \) in the list for query \( q \), then MAP is calculated as:

$\text{MAP} = \frac{1}{Q} \sum_{q=1}^{Q} \left( \frac{1}{\text{number of relevant documents for } q} \sum_{k=1}^{n_q} P(k, q) \times \text{rel}(k, q) \right)$

where \( \text{rel}(k, q) \) is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank \( k \) is a relevant document for query \( q \), and 0 otherwise.

MAP is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to understand how well your system retrieves all relevant documents and also how well it ranks them. It's widely used in:

- Search engines.
- Recommender systems.
- Image retrieval systems.
- Any domain where the order of retrieval is as important as the retrieval itself.

##### ↳ Where else would mAP be useful? 

- Search engines.
- Recommender systems.
- Image retrieval systems.
- object detection (i.e. localisation and classification). Localization determines the location of an instance (e.g. bounding box coordinates) and classification tells you what it is (e.g. a dog or cat).
- Segmentation systems
- Any domain where the **order of retrieval** (ranking) is as important as the retrieval itself

Mean Average Precision(mAP) is a metric used to evaluate object detection models such as Fast R-CNN, [YOLO](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/yolo-object-detection), Mask R-CNN, etc.
