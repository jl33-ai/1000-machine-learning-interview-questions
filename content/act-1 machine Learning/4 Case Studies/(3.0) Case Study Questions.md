##### How are test cases (for testing **algorithms**), akin to test data for **machine learning** models? 

All models are non-deterministic algorithms. (quote relevant)

Your **accuracy** must represent the problem at hand, and otherwise you can't really reliably gauge how 'accurate' model is. The data defines your interpretation of the quality of your algorithm/model. 

Both algorithms and machine learning algorithms should be made more robust by testing against or feeding more edge cases.

##### You've been hired by `Goose Goose Go` to implement an 'auto-complete' feature for their new search engine. How would you go about this? 

1. **Algorithmic:** Just use [[2.9 Tries|tries]]
2. **Machine learning**:
