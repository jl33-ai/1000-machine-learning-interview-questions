We made a ***design decision*** to cover the foundational linear algebra and calculus in the 'quantitative finance' section - this is a completely arbitrary choice; the section itself has no relevance to finance. So if you would like to learn, go [[1.4 Linear Algebra (easy)|here]]. 

This section however does offer some questions more relevant to what you may encounter in an actual machine learning interview, hence the titular *'linear algebra and calculus for ML'*.
