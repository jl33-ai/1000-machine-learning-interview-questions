##### Q2) What is a function?

> ☞ **Function**: A function is a machine that takes in an input and maps it to an output.

If you have a reasonable understanding of machine learning, you can appreciate that all 'machine learning models' are really just abstracted 'functions' which take in data and spit out a result
- The same way the function $f(x) = x^2$ takes in the **number** $x$, and returns the **number squared**
- Or the function below takes in a **list**, and returns the **list sorted**

```python
def sort_list(my_list):
	return sorted(my_list)
```

 - A machine learning model takes in **data** and returns an **answer**, but often both the process of going from input to output is much more complicated than a simple $y=x^2$
 - You should really think about most machine learning models as plain old **functions**

Universality theorems are a commonplace in computer science, so much so that we sometimes forget how astonishing they are. But it's worth reminding ourselves: the ability to compute an arbitrary function is truly remarkable. Almost any process you can imagine can be thought of as function computation. Consider the problem of naming a piece of music based on a short sample of the piece. That can be thought of as computing a function. Or consider the problem of translating a Chinese text into English. Again, that can be thought of as computing a function**Actually, computing one of many functions, since there are often many acceptable translations of a given piece of text.. Or consider the problem of taking an mp4 movie file and generating a description of the plot of the movie, and a discussion of the quality of the acting. Again, that can be thought of as a kind of function computation**Ditto the remark about translation and there being many possible functions.. Universality means that, in principle, neural networks can do all these things and many more.

A vector valued function (also called a vector function) is **a function (not a vector) that outputs a vector, as opposed to a scalar or real value**.

- plain and simple. 
- It is quite 
- The better the data represents the problem, the better the results. 
- 'You are what you eat'
- The model is trained on the data. If the data is fundamentally wrong, then the model will still do the right thing - it may learn the data **perfectly** - but as a result, the model's output is also wrong due to the data being wrong. 
- Remember how the model uses data to estimate its parameters so that it can adjust itself to perform well on unseen data? Clearly, bad data will lead to poor estimates of these parameters. I should be clean, and representative of the unseen data that will be fed into it; if you're trying to train a model to recognise dog breeds, you wouldn't feed it pictrues of trains would you.

##### Please show me, with your hands, what the graph of $e^x$ and $log_e(x)$ look like. 

Firstly, there are inverses of each other (reflected on the diagonal line $y=x$). 

These two functions are fundamental to data science, machine learning, and deep learning. They are used relentlessly in statistics and probability - basically cannot use them without it. Therefore it's important to have a solid grasp of how they behave. 

They're used in [[softmax]], [[mutual information]]

###### Why are e^x and the natural log so common in probability and machine learning? What is so special about e? 

The number \( e \) (approximately 2.71828) and its associated functions, \( e^x \) (the exponential function) and the natural logarithm (\(\ln(x)\)), are fundamental in probability and machine learning for several reasons:

### 1. Continuous Growth and Decay
- **Exponential Growth**: The exponential function \( e^x \) is the mathematical representation of continuous growth. When something grows at a rate proportional to its current size (like interest in banking or population growth), it's described by \( e^x \).
- **Continuous Compounding**: In finance, \( e \) arises from the limit of compound interest as the number of compounding periods becomes infinitely large.

### 2. Mathematical Properties
- **Differentiation and Integration**: One of the most remarkable properties of \( e^x \) is that its derivative is itself. This makes calculations involving differential equations simpler, which is essential in many machine learning algorithms, especially those involving continuous optimization.
- **Simplifies Calculations**: The natural logarithm (\(\ln(x)\)) is the inverse of the exponential function. It transforms multiplicative relationships into additive ones, simplifying many calculations.

### 3. Probability and Statistics
- **Normal Distribution**: In statistics, the normal (Gaussian) distribution, a fundamental probability distribution, has \( e \) in its equation. This distribution is pivotal in many statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.
- **Information Theory**: In information theory, entropy (a measure of uncertainty or surprise) is often calculated using the natural logarithm. This choice is partly because the natural logarithm measures the number of e-folding times needed to reach a certain level of growth.

### 4. Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Log-Likelihood**: Many machine learning models (like logistic regression) use the natural logarithm in the log-likelihood function, which is maximized to fit the model to the data.
- **Activation Functions**: Exponential functions are used in certain activation functions in neural networks, such as the softmax function, which generalizes the logistic function to multiple classes.

### 5. Universality of e
- **Ubiquitous in Nature**: The number \( e \) appears in many natural phenomena (such as patterns of growth and decay, the distribution of prime numbers, etc.), making it a natural choice for models that attempt to mimic or understand natural processes.

### Conclusion
The prevalence of \( e \) and its related functions in probability and machine learning is due to their unique mathematical properties, their natural appearance in growth/decay processes, their fundamental role in statistics and information theory, and their utility in simplifying complex mathematical expressions. These functions provide a powerful toolkit for modeling a wide range of phenomena in machine learning and beyond.

###### QX) What are the two types of data? 

Structured

Unstructured

A good proxy for how 'structured' something is, is how easy it would be to represent the data in a table. I.e: very hard for images/videos, very easy for a company's expenses


<br>

---

###### QX) What is metadata with an example? 

> ☞ Metadata is data that describes other data.

**Example** 
When you take a photo on your phone, the details that come up when you press (ℹ︎) are metadata describing the main data - the image.  
`Time_taken: 2:03:29am`
`Location: The White House`
`Size: 16MP`
`Dimensions: 1440x1440`

##### In statistics and machine learning, what do we mean by random noise? 

> [!check]
> - Random noise in statistics and machine learning is the term used for the unpredictable and irregular fluctuations that are present in all datasets. It’s like the static you hear on the radio or the grain you see on a photograph, which doesn’t come from the actual music or the image itself, but from random disturbances that can’t be controlled. In data, noise could come from measurement errors, slight variations in the process being measured, or other unknown factors that cause the data to vary even under identical conditions.
> - For instance, if you’re measuring the height of a plant every day to track its growth, factors like slight differences in how you place the ruler, small tremors in your hand, or even changes in room temperature that slightly expand or contract the ruler could introduce noise to your measurements. This noise is not related to the actual growth of the plant, but it still affects your data.

<br>

##### How should machine learning algorithms interpret noise? 

> [!check] In machine learning
> - We want our algorithms to learn from the real patterns in the data (the signal) and ignore this noise. However, it's often challenging because noise can mask the true patterns we're interested in. 
> - A bad model may accidentally [[1.2 Easy Questions#What is overfitting?|overfit]], mistaking the random noise for the underlying pattern, and thus making wrong predictions later down the line. 
> - A good model will be able to distinguish between the signal and the noise, focusing on the true patterns that help make accurate predictions or decisions.


<br>

###### What is overfitting? 

A model that is overfit has low bias (good) and high variance (bad). 
This happens when the model learns noise and fluctuations in the training data as if they were significant features.
It thus performs poorly on real, unseen data. 

In the context of machine learning models, overfitting is when the model 'learns' the **training data** too well, resulting in almost no bias, but high variance. 

**Let's say** *Tao* is studying (learning) for an upcoming exam. 

- **Memorizing past exam papers** is akin to a model that overfits to its training data.
- **New questions on the exam** represent new, unseen data for a predictive model.
- **Genuine understanding of the material** is similar to a well-generalized model that can perform well on both training and unseen data.

###### What evaluation metrics do we use to evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning model?

###### Bias/Variance tradeoff 

- Bias: measures the tendency of the model to fit the **training data**
- Variance: this type of model tends (graph)




<br> 

---

##### How is this different to statistical bias/variance

In statistics, an estimator (model) is unbiased if, in the long run, its average value is equal to the **true underlying value**.

A model's variance measures how varied its results are 

<br>

###### What is inference?

> ☞ **𝐌𝐋 inference** is basically just the act of actually **using the trained model** on new, unseen data. It is the post-training step where the model applies its learned knowledge to provide outputs for inputs it **hasn't encountered during training**. Essentially, it's where the model is put to work in practical applications, such as predicting outcomes, classifying data, or generating content.

> **Statistical inference** is the process of drawing conclusions about a **larger population** or **underlying data process** based on a sample from that population. E.g what is the mean weight of boys at your school, based on the mean weight of boys in your class ✻.

##### What is a hyperparameter? 

> [!check] Hyperparameter

- Hyperparameters are not learnt from the data, but chosen before the learning process begins. 
- High level 'settings' of a model
- Best understood via examples: 
	- The number of layers in a [[1.1 neural-networks|neural network]]
	- The 'k' in [[2.5 KNN|KNN]].
	- The kernel type in [[2.9.2 Support Vector Machines|SVM's]].

<br>

##### What is a validation set? 

- Different to train and test set. It is derived from a division of the training set. 


To be very clear: 
1. training set
2. validation set (test against, then adjust model or hyperparameters)
3. testing set (finally, )

<br>

###### ↳ Why couldn't you just use the test set for this? 

The use of a validation set is crucial for model selection because it can help to estimate the model's performance and select the best model and hyperparameters without using the test set. **The test set should only be used once** to avoid biasing the model performance metrics.

By this, I mean that if you adjusted the hyperparameters based on the test set, you would simply be optimizing the setup the perform best on that particular test set, which may not be representative of the true data, and thus you have the issue again.

The test set should only be used once because using it multiple times during the model selection and tuning process can lead to "leakage" where information about the test set leaks into the model. This can cause you to inadvertently tune your model to perform well on the test set, rather than on new, unseen data.

<br>

###### ↳ What are the three main ways of creating the validation set? 


- **Holdout Method**: Simply dividing your dataset into separate training, validation, and test sets.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Dividing your dataset into K parts, using K-1 parts for training and the remaining part for validation. This is repeated K times with a different part used as the validation set each time.
- **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation**: A special case of cross-validation where the number of folds equals the number of instances in the dataset, essentially using all but one instance for training and the last instance for validation, repeated for each instance in the dataset.
