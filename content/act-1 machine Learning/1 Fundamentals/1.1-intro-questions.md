###### What does 'Data Science' mean to you? Why did you pick Data Science?

> ☞ Data science is a **multidisciplinary** field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract **knowledge and insights** from structured and unstructured data or generate new models.

Since this is a **highly personal** question, I will just list my (the author) own reasons. 
Nonetheless - make sure you have a **crystal clear answer** for this question. 

*"Well, thanks for asking. The main reason I fell in love with data science is because..."*
- Joma tech video 
- data science was originally called...
- This is your opportunity to demonstrate genuine enthusiasm and passion to the interviewer, and call upon personal anecdotes. 
- what got you interested?

###### **Everyone's talking about AI these days. Can you tell me: what Artificial Intelligence actually means?**

> ☞ **AI describes** anything created to perform a task which **usually requires human intelligence.**

$$\text{Artificial Intelligence} \geq 👤🧠$$
- (We are trying to match if not exceed human intelligence)
- Furthermore, **Machine Learning** describes a subclass of algorithms to solve problems that cannot be **explicitly programmed** by humans.

###### (A) What is the difference between narrow and wide AI? 

**Narrow AI**
- Designed to perform a specific task
- It operates under a limited, predefined range or set of parameters
- **For example**: chatbots, recommendation systems, image recognition

**Wide AI**
- Agnostic to any specific task, simply 'intelligent' like a human being, able to perform any task and apply its intelligence across any domain. 
- Able to learn from experience, and adapt to new information through transfer learning.

###### Why is it crucial to actually 'look at' your data; whether this be the raw data in rows and columns, or through graphs?

- The brain itself is a model; and is programmed to recognise certain patterns **extremely effectively** (there is a reason the architecture of neural networks parallels on the structure of our brains)
(Show a sick picture (midjourney) of like idk a red box around a mother's face)
(threat)


- To spot anomalies and do **bare minimum** verification of the data's legitimacy - so many errors avoided if you could just.

###### Q5) **Please tell me about a time when you have used Machine Learning in your own life.**

Make sure you keep a personal list, in order of **interesting-ness** (you can't talk about all of them)

- Daily routines - perhaps you made a script to make your life easier
- Real Projects (uni, jobs, hackathons)
- Food classifier
- University assignments
- Yes/No
- Food thing
- Hagen's Organics

WIth machine learning and deep learning inevitably comes mathematical language

If you don't understand this, it's not becuase you don't understand math. It's because you don't understand how to ***read*** math.

*⁂ Note, these are just ways to describe ML systems, they do not necessarily fall neatly into each of these categories! For example: [[2.20 Recommender Systems]].* 



<br>



**Supervised learning**: Supervised Machine Learning refers to a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means the algorithm is provided with input-output pairs. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs and make predictions on new, unseen data based on this learned mapping.

**Unsupervised learning** does not have (or need) any labeled outputs, so its goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points.

**Semi-supervised learning** aims to label unlabeled data points using knowledge learned from a small number of labeled data points.

**Reinforcement learning**

##### What is classification? Can you name some examples?

> [!check] Classification
> - The art of classifying a bunch of objects into two or more categories. 

**Examples**

- Is this email spam or not spam (`true/false`)
- Is this loan application good or bad (`1/0`)
- Is this animal in this picture a dog, cat, or bird? (`a, b, c`)
- Who is in this photo? (Facial detection)
- Which letter is in this photo? (`a-z`)
- Is this wine good or bad? (`1/0`)
- Is this stock going up or down (`1/0`)

<br>

##### ↳ What is prediction/regression 

> [!check] Prediction/Regression
> - Predicts an attribute associated with an object
> - Yields continuous values instead of categorical variables

**Examples**
- Stock price forecasting
- Weather forecasting

###### What is active learning?

##### some models are heuristiic, some ,...

###### Q1) Let's say you want to make a model. What are the general steps you take? 
**First principles**

The holistic machine learning recipe (chant this every night before you go to sleep): 
1. **Acquire data**
2. **Clean and prepare data** into good features
3. **Split the data** into **training** and **testing** set
4. **Pick a model** (the fun part)
	1. **Traditional Statistical models:** linear regression, logistic regression
	2. **ML Model:** decision tree, kNN
	3. **Deep Learning:** cNN{algorithm which assigns weight to features, takes input, automatically takes additional features - helpful for images or Natural language where manual feature  engineering}
5. **Train:** train data is fed into algorithm to build model

> ☞ In machine learning, ***training the algorithm*** can be thought of as ***learning*** which is really just ***estimating the parameters of the model***

6. **Test:** test data used to evaluate the accurate or error of the model

<br>

##### How to select different models? 

- Comparing, validating and choosing parameters and models 
- Improve model accuracy via parameter tuning

##### Dimensionality Reduction ≠ PCA

- Reducing the number of random variables (features, columns) to consider
- Increases model efficiency


##### Pre-processing

- Feature extraction and normalization
- `Raw input data -> usable with ML Algorithms`


---

##### What is Machine Learning?

> ☞ **Machine Learning**: How to teach a computer a task, without explicitly programming it to perform said task. Instead, feed data into an algorithm to gradually improve outcomes through experience. 

<br>

##### What two different types of tasks do all machine learning models do?

> ☞ **Classification** of present data into categories
$f(\text{data})→\text{classification}$

> ☞ **Prediction** about the future
$f(\text{data})→\text{prediction}$

regression?
