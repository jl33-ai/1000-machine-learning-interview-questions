Dynamic? Programming?

Dynamic programming is similar to deep learning in the sense that you get extremely complex and intelligent behaviour for free, by defining simple rules

Explain the iterative recursive build up of knowledge, bank on FACTS and abstract them

##### Longest valid parenthesis
`LC-32`
Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring. 

```
Input: s = ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".
```

##### Sliding Window

```python
# e.g [5, 3, 6, 2, 7]
l = 0
max_profit = 0

for r in range(1, len(prices)):
	curr_profit = prices[r]-prices[l]
	if curr_profit < 0:
		l=r
	max_profit = max(curr_profit, max_profit)
	
return max_profit
```

- This is considered a **sliding window** problem and **dynamic programming** problem. They often go hand in hand. 
- It is dynamic programming because at every new `[0, i]` window, you're checking whether including this new price point would be better than the known maximum out of the `[0, i-1]` window.
	- You check this by leveraging the fact that you know `l` must be the smallest value so far, since at each step `curr_profit` can only go negative if a number at the `i` index is smaller than the number at the `l` index.
