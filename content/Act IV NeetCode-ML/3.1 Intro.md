I like using C++ cos a) it's just another language, other than the millions who know python b) it's fun as FUCK c) it forces you to slow down (good for learning algorithms) and think about the implications of what you're writing on the machine; closer to low level, machine code. Closer to the Truth of what you're really programming. 

Sometimes it's nice to take a break from the probabilistic nature of machine learning algorithms and focus on some more methodical, determinist algorithms. This is the nature of this section. It will cover the programming fluency and algorithmic thinking which **any data scientist** should possess. 

Most MLE roles will involve some leetcode style questions

Leetcode is obviously about cracking the algorithm -> and then implementing in whatever language you choose. 

Takes you through all common data structures and algorithms, as well as algorithmic paradigms
- DFS
- BFS
- Dynamic Programming

Use pen and paper 

Use the test cases !!!. no ego
holy shit when you can copy the test cases in and gah I'm so dumb. Notice things. 

<p align='center'>Bite Sized Leetcodes to practice Algorithmic Thinking</p>

the toolkit:
- dp
- stack
- dsliding window 
- divide conquer 
- dict/set (hash map)
- dfs
- bfs
- 
- recursion (maybe)



My single biggest piece of leetcode advice: 

***Redo the ones you did a few weeks ago.***

Yes everyone just wants to wsee that number tick up. 
But at some point the input/value curve slows down....
you actually get much more from redo'ing leetcodes: you can actually redo them, and better. 
At a certain point you get more out of repeating old ones than doing new ones. 
That said, increasing your breadth truly matters if you memorise the method each time, as it gives you better odds in the interview. 

Omg I fucking get it. Normally you stop oince you JUST get it and move on. But if you go back to it. You get it in such a way that you're like wait how did I ever not get this.

Algorithms can be rote-learning. At first, the number of things they can test you on seems unlimited, but as you cover more ground, you realise that it is actually quite limited. You'll get better at.

Bite-sized mental leetcodes - to see if you can figure out the optimal 'approach' mentally
Do you know how you're 'meant' to do it? can you see the **key observation**.

Tips and tricks
- comment the time complexity 
- justify each line

Beyond cracking the question algorthimicall, some other things you can do 
- Handle edge cases well 
- Talk through your approach fluently 
- Ask clarifying questions 

**One sentence answers**. short n sweet. get the gist. because n since

###### Q1) **Longest Common Prefix**

```
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

EG
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

**Solution**: Sort the array of strings and compare the first and last words from the start; a mismatch between them implies the end of the common prefix - due to lexicographical sorting. 

**Time complexity**

`Total: O(m•n•log(n))`
- **Where** $n$ is the number of words in the list 
- **Where** $n \cdot log(n)$ is the cost of sorting $n$ words
- **Because** $m$ is the maximum number of letters to iterate through (out of the first or last word)

###### Q2) **Water Container**

###### Q4) **2-Sum**

---

###### Q5) **3-Sum**
```
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

EG
Input:         nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output:               [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

- **Hint 1)** You have to get it down from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$ 
- **Hint 2)** Exploit the fact that every index $i, j, k$ must be unique 
- **Hint 3)** Sort the list
- **The Idea)**

###### Q7) Travelling Salesman




###### Q8) Palindrome

Problem: `How to find the longest palindrome`
Solution: 



###### Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

I included this one because it's deceptively hard. Seems so trivial but actually tricky to implement in any language (well, for me)

(diagramo of keypad)

**Solution:** There's no clever 'trick', but if you understand the recursive function that's just as impressive. 

- Base cases: 
	- You've gotten a string long enough to 
	- You've reached the end of the 'digits'
- Recursive case: 
	- 
(stack diagram)


```python
def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:

	if digits=="":
		return []
	d = ["", "","abc","def","ghi","jkl","mno","pqrs","tuv","wxyz"]
	n = len(digits)
	output = []
	def addto(i, s):
		if len(s) == n:
			output.append("".join(s))
			return
		if i == n:
			return
		for j in d[int(digits[i])]:
			s.append(j)
			addto(i+1, s)
			s.pop()
		return
	addto(0, [])
	return output
```
