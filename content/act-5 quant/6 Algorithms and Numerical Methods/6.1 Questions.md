##### What is a convex optimization problem? 

> [!check] Convex Optimization Problem
> This refers to a specific subset of optimization problems where the objective function is convex, and the feasible region (if any constraints exist) is also a convex set. Convex problems have the property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, which makes them particularly nice for optimization.
