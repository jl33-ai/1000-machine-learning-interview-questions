 uuuThis deserves its own textbook. 

The single most important thing to know about the normal distribution is that it is like the **mother distribution**. It describes so many real world phenomenon, due to the fact that it arises as the **sum of many random variables.** 

And when you think about it, most phenomenon - human height, the number of trains passing through a station - are the result of a sum of many random variables, and thus **asymptotically** normal. 

Note how relaxed these assumptions are: 
- they don't even need to be normal
- they don't need to be normal themselves
- they don't even really need to be independent

###### Q1) **What is the bell-shaped distribution used to model many natural phenomena?**
`Normal Distribution`
(we will come back to this)

###### Q2) **How can we model a random variable that is equally likely to take on any value in a given range?**
`Uniform`

The uniform distribution models a random variable that is equally likely to take on any value within a given range. Its parameters are:
- \( a \) and \( b \) which are the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
- Expected value (mean) = \( \frac{a+b}{2} \)
- Variance = \( \frac{(b-a)^2}{12} \)
