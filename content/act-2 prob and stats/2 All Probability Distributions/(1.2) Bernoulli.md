###### A) **What is a Bernoulli trial and a Bernoulli distribution?**
`Bernoulli` #Discrete

A Bernoulli trial is a **random experiment** (e.g., a coin toss) in which a **dichotomy** is observed (e.g., only heads or tails). 

The Bernoulli distribution models the outcome of a single Bernoulli trial. Its PMF is:
\[ P(X=1) = p \]
\[ P(X=0) = 1-p \]
Where:
- \( p \) is the probability of success (e.g., getting heads).
- Expected value (mean) = \( p \)
- Variance = \( p(1-p) \)

**Special Facts**
- Describes the distribution of the **indicator random variable** $\mathbb{1}$
