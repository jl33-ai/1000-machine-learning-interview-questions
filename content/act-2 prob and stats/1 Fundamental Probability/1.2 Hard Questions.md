###### Casino - Higher Card
*A casino offers a simple card game. There are 52 cards in a deck with 4 cards for each value $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, \overset{\text{jack}}{J}, \overset{\text{queen}}{Q}, \overset{\text{king}}{K}, \overset{\text{ace}}{A}$ ... The cards are thoroughly shuffled, so that each card has an equal chance of being selected. You take a card from the deck first, and the dealer takes another without replacement. If you have a larger number you win; if the numbers are equal or yours is smaller, the house wins. Does the house have the better odds of winning? If so, what is your probability of winning?*

☞ The house has better odds of winning 

☞ Break it down into what happens for each scenario (each card picked first)

☞ For example, what is the probability of you winning if you select a $5$ 

☞ Now do this for each card  **(2, 3, ..., Ace)**

☞ And then simply multiply by your probability of choosing each card in the first place
