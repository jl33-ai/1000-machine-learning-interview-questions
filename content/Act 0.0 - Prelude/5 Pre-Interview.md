### Addressing Luck

☞ Yes, there is **tons** of luck involved. 

☞ You might be just as deserving of the role as the next candidate, **if not more**. 

☞ But from the **point of view** of the company, they do not care. 

☞ No matter who they pick, they are receiving a **9/10 candidate**

☞ Yes, there is **tons** of luck involved. Your success depends on the sum of many **random variables**:
- Depends on how well you sleep the night before
	- Whether they ask you that one topic you spent ages on
		- Whether you get paired up with an interview who likes you
			- Etc...

☞ You cannot control the outcome of these **random variables** on the day. Such is the nature of **randomness** - as a data scientist/mathematician/quant, you **must** come to terms with this.

☞ You can't control your observations. What you **can control** is your distributions.

Clearly, is it possible for **candidate A** to outperform **candidate B** on the day. **But who would bet on?**

Don't be **scared**! You're much smarter than you think you are. This stuff is a lot easier than you think it is.
