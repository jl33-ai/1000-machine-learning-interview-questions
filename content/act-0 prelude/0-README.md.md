# FAQ

- Is this only for people who plan to interview? 
	- No, it's for everyone.  
- Who wrote this? 
	- [[1 requirements.txt|Me]]
- Why is it called '**D**ata **S**cience **X**' if it encompasses machine learning, programming and quant finance? 
	- Because data science was the original name for computer science. Because machine learning is a subset of data science. And because Quant Finance is just an interesting application of Machine Learning and Math. 
- How should I use this book? 
	- **1)** For interview practice (duh). **2)** As a textbook-like learning resource. **3)** As a checklist of things to cover. 
-  Why are there so many **Minecraft** references?
	- Mine your own business.

# How this Book Works

This book is designed to be ***fun and efficient.*** 

```python

It is non-linear: (show each textbook as a node in a graph) and like a green yes/ No

### Question Difficulty

*All interview-style questions, with only **3 tiers** of difficulty.* 

Within each section the questions get progressively harder, and sections may be partitioned into difficulty level. 

We have tried hard to make the questions as close-ended as possible, because open-ended questions are annoying and unhelpful. 

⍰ **Easy/Hard questions** target the concepts and theory. 
☞ "What is `2+2`?"
☞ "How do you understand feature importance in multivariate regression?"

⍰ **Case studies** are open-ended, hypothetical-situation, application-based questions and require high technical fluency. For example: 
☞ "Whats the most fun way to make a snake game" *(Jane Street, Final Interview)*
☞ "How would you go about predicting churn for XYZ" *(Atlassian, Final Interview)*
**Some are hypothetical, some are real-world case studies.**

# Your Knowledge Level

This book covers everything, but that doesn't mean you have to cover everything. 

It works **independently** of your level of knowledge... 
☞ If you know nothing, you learn from the answers, 
☞ If you know everything, you'll get practice from the questions. 

You'll see what I mean. 

The book is very **loosely** structured into only THREE main sections. Just read it from the start, in a linear fashion, and see how far you get. Questions are assorted. They will tend to get more niche, specialised and difficult. There are brain teasers sprinkled throughout. more of a repository than a textbook; but it works if you read it top to bottom. It's inherently non linear; an non-directed graph, as you can see. Jump around from topic to topic and slowly fill in the gaps. If you have enough knowledge to read it linearly, you probably hold 3 different PhD's. I have used tags and structuring to allow you to hop between different topics. Questions are designed to be MECE

# How to Read

- How would you feel if Python only executed 60% of your code? 
- All unnecessary noise, cleaned away (sketch)
- technically the book is self contained... you can... 
- think of scary the word 'cardiovascular' looked the first time you read it. Simple logic hides behind all the scary words in this book. It's called Jargon. 
- Understanding > Memorising > Reading 
- Look say cover write check. Just because you read the answer $\implies$ doesn't mean you will answer it in an interview. 
-  in your own words - or even just reading from the answers. Your interview **cannot** be the first time you've ever tried to articulate these concepts aloud. 

Follow the pointers ☞ (not `C`).

# Philosophies of this Book

##### 1) The philosophy of this book is to explain things in plain english.

Quality does not increase with quantity of fancy words. 


![[fancy jargon.svg | 500]]


- Furthermore, most resources only tell you '**about**' models. 
- They don't really work through the exact mechanics of **how they work**
	- and the ones that do, are so math-dense that they're basically unreadable. 

##### 2) I've always believed **asking** is better than **telling**; that's why this book is structured as an interview instead of an informatory textbook. 

##### 3) Written with pedagogy in mind


Trust in first principles. Everything is just small layers of logic built on top of each other, everything. If you don't get something, backtrack until you find the missing piece of logic
