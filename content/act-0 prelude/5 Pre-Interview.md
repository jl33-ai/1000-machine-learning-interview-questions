### Tips, tricks, and hacks

*This section borrows and provides some tips, tricks, and life hacks borrowing from some excellent books.* 

**Harvard Consulting Book** 
Yes it's consulting, but they're great at breaking down the general steps of how to **get into places**.

1. Don't be **scared**! You're much smarter than you think you are, and this stuff is a lot easier than you think it is. Top 3 regrets are always: I wish I wasn't as scared, I wish I just a) started learning this thing sooner, didn't realise it'd be so easy/fun. b) wish I just applied, I actually had a chance + woul dhave been good practice anyways.

### Addressing Luck

☞ Yes, there is **tons** of luck involved. 

☞ You might be just as deserving of the role as the next candidate, **if not more**. 

☞ But from the **point of view** of the company, they do not care. 

☞ No matter who they pick, they are receiving a **9/10 candidate**

☞ Yes, there is **tons** of luck involved. Your success depends on the sum of many **random variables**:
- Depends on how well you sleep the night before
	- Whether they ask you that one topic you spent ages on
		- Whether you get paired up with an interview who likes you
			- Etc...

☞ You cannot control the outcome of these **random variables** on the day. Such is the nature of **randomness** - as a data scientist/mathematician/quant, you **must** come to terms with this.

☞ You can't control your observations. What you **can control** is your distributions.

Clearly, is it possible for **candidate A** to outperform **candidate B** on the day. But who would you bet on?

**Don't stress about the outcomes you can't control; focus on changing your distribution.**

# Rules

**Rule 1:** $\overset{Expectation}{\mathbb{E}(X)} = 0$

**Rule 2:** 
```python
class Interview: 
	def interview(self):
		if you_know_ur_stuff:
			interview()
			be.yourself()
			speak(confidently) && speak(clearly) 
			# Remember: confidence comes from preparation
		else:
			continue reading
	def preparation(self):
		while True: 
			Read()
			Understand() # everything in Data Science is about intuitive explanations
			Memorise()   #
			Practice() 
```

**Rule 3:**
Success is one-to-one with effort, with the exception of a little bit of **error**

$$\mathbb{S}=f(\text{E})+\epsilon, \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma)$$
