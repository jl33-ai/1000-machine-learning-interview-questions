> 	- ($-$) If it's negative, they're pointing in opposite directions.

> $$
> - This naturally leads to **cosine similarity**, which, like the dot product, measures the similarity of two vectors but considering only their direction.

*"Um, what is a dot product? Okay so, the dot product of two vectors provides a measure of their similarity in terms of magnitude and direction, representing the sum of their element-wise products. Cosine similarity, derived from the dot product, normalizes this by the magnitudes of the vectors, effectively measuring the cosine of the angle between them. 
It's crucial in ML for gauging similarity in high-dimensional spaces, like in text analysis or recommendation systems, where the direction of the vectors (representing features or items) matters more than their magnitude."*

##### What is Vector Projection?
$$
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{b}\|^2} \mathbf{b}
$$
   - Explanation: The vector projection of \(\mathbf{a}\) onto \(\mathbf{b}\) is a vector that represents the component of \(\mathbf{a}\) in the direction of \(\mathbf{b}\).


---

##### What is Scalar Projection?
$$
\text{comp}_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}
$$
   - Explanation: The scalar projection is the length of the vector projection, representing how much of one vector goes in the direction of another.
   - This also leads to another interpretation of the [[#What is a dot product?|dot product]], that is: 
	   - The dot product can be seen as the product of the magnitude of one vector and the projection of the other vector onto the first. This is especially useful in physics for calculating work done when a force is applied along a distance.

##### What is the Magnitude (Norm) of a Vector?

\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = [a_2b_3 - a_3b_2, a_3b_1 - a_1b_3, a_1b_2 - a_2b_1]
$$
   - Explanation: The cross product of two vectors results in a vector that is perpendicular to both and is used in 3D space to determine the area of parallelograms and the direction of normals.

##### How are Linear Equations Represented in Matrix Form?
$$
A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}

###### What is a vector?



###### QX) What is invariance?

Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of invariance in statistics, computer science, and machine learning:

1. Statistics:
   - Invariance Principle: It relates to estimators that retain their properties even when subjected to certain transformations.
   - Example: Consider the median as an estimator of central location. If you add a constant to each data point in a dataset, the median of the transformed data will be the median of the original data plus the constant. This makes the median invariant to shifts.
   - The variance is LOCATION INVARIANT (sketch)
   - The MLE is invariant: 
   - A function of a sufficient statistic is also sufficient 
   - Variance in invariant 
   - Formula: If \(M\) is the median of dataset \(X\), then the median of \(X + c\) (where \(c\) is a constant) is $M + c$.


2. Machine Learning:
   - Invariance: A model's ability to provide consistent outputs despite certain transformations to the input.
   - Example: A convolutional neural network (CNN) used for image recognition might be designed to recognize a cat whether it's zoomed-in, rotated, or shifted, making the CNN invariant to these transformations.
   - Formula: Let \(f\) be a model. If $f(x) = f(T(x))$ for a transformation \(T\) (like rotation or scaling), then \(f\) is invariant to \(T\).

I hope this provides a clear understanding of invariance in these domains!

###### What does it mean for something to be 'proportional to' something else? 

- covariance matrices 

---

- eigenvalues/vectors - what is the logic behind 

$$Av = \lambda v$$
$v$: The eigenvector (a vector)
$A$: The matrix which acts on $v$ to 'transform it'
$\lambda$: The eigenvalue (a scalar number)

So you find $v$ and $\lambda$ for a given matrix $A$, such that transforming (multiplying) the vector by $A$ does not change its direction, only its magnitude (by an amount $\lambda$.
