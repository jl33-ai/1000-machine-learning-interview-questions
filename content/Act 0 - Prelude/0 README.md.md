# Rules

**Rule 1:** $\overset{Expectation}{\mathbb{E}(X)} = 0$

**Rule 2:** 
```python
class Interview: 
	def interview(self):
		if you_know_ur_stuff:
			interview()
			be.yourself()
			speak(confidently) && speak(clearly) 
			# Remember: confidence comes from preparation
		else:
			continue reading
	def preparation(self):
		while True: 
			Read()
			Understand() # everything in Data Science is about intuitive explanations
			Memorise()   #
			Practice() 
```

**Rule 3:**
Success is one-to-one with effort, with the exception of a little bit of **error**

$$\mathbb{S}=f(\text{E})+\epsilon, \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma)$$
