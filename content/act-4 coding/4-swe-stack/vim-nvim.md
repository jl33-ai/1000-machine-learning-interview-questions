##### Why use `vim` in the command line when Visual Studio and other IDE's exist? 

Using `vim` in the command line is advantageous for several reasons. 

1. Firstly, it is lightweight and fast, making it suitable for remote editing over SSH or on systems with limited resources. 
2. Secondly, Vim is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor their editing environment precisely. 
3. Thirdly, Vim's keyboard-centric approach reduces the need for mouse usage, potentially enhancing editing speed and efficiency.
