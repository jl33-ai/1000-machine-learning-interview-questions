- NATIVELY COMPILED LANGUAGE; straight to machine code. 
- C sharp and java are compiled in a virtual environemtn? 

![[compiling.png]]

Doesn't run as fast as other compiled, but compiles (builds) more quickly

##### `package main`

##### Write a function to print `Hello world` to the console in Go.

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

##### Go code generally runs ____ than interpreted languages and compiles ____ than other compiled languages like C and Rust

##### 

`main.go` -> `go build` -> `myprogram.exe`

- can run the executable without having Go, doesn't even know was made with Go. 
- Different to python - need python interpreter

##### On bootdev

- Code gets shipped to serve, compiled, run. 
- Compiler vs. Runtime error

processors are not chatGPT< they need machine code. 

how to distribute python code vs. compiled code

`main.py` (interpreted) - give your friend `main.py` and on their computer they run `python main.py`
friend needs python installed on computer (dependent)  - need to know how to use a command line

`main.go` -> compile, then you can sell, without giving away the source code. 

##### Do users of compiled programs need acess to source code? (Hypotheticals) - Mai


- compiled binaries are good (also in servers)
- strong and static typing
	- when you declare a string = "wagslane" can't accidentally be changed later 
	- we find bugs in compilation instead of running (compile time error)

Drums in the background. 

- can do operatioin with consts as long as they can be known at compile time.

##### Function signature: `func concat(a string, b string) string {`

strongly vs statically typed

- **Strong vs Weak Typing:**
    
    - Strongly typed languages enforce strict type rules, making implicit type conversions rare.
    - Weakly typed languages allow more flexibility in type handling, often performing implicit type conversions.
- **Static vs Dynamic Typing:**
    
    - Statically typed languages require variable types to be declared at compile-time.
    - Dynamically typed languages determine variable types at runtime, and type checking is performed during execution.

Camel case vs. snake case
	Callback: a function that can be passed to another function to be called later. 

`func f(g func(int, int) int, n int) int`

`f func(func(int, int) int, int) int`



Memory: 


by value (unless explicitly..) vs. by reference

- **GO does not allow unused variables**

- implicit naked returns = bad

- named returns 

early returns / gaurd clauses
- they provide a linear approach to lgic trees. 

`nil` `error`

heuristic used by developers

- struct is first of the collection types: a type that contains other types. 
	- dictionairy

```go
type car struct {
	Make string
	Model string
	Height int 
	Width int
	FrontWheel Wheel
} 
```



1. statically typed language; types must be inferred or specified, and they cannot change. `var myVariable string` or `var myvariable = "string"`
2. strongly typed: operation you can perform on variable depends on its type. Compiler can do more thorough debugging
3. GO is compiled - binary machine code file. Python is interpreted. 
4. Fast compile time 
5. Built in concurrency: no packages needed (parallelism, goroutines)
6. Simplicity; garbage collection - frees up unused memory

`package main`

`go build`

`go run`

```go
package main
import ("errors"
		"fmt")

func main() {
	var printValue = "i don't know what to do"
	printMe(printValue)
}

func printMe(printValue string) {
	fmt.Println(printValue)
}

func intDivision(numerator int, denominator int) (int, int) {
	var result int = numerator/denominator
	var remainder int = numerator%denominator
	return result, remainder
}


```

default value 0, int-error

lazy evaluation 

```go
switch{
	case err!=nil:
	case remainder==0:
	default
}

// conditional switch statement
switch remainder{
	case err!=nil:
	case remainder==0:
	default
}
```


ARRAYS
fixed length
same type
indexable
continguous in memory

```go
func main(){
	var intArr [3]int32 // 12 bytes
}

fmt.Println(&intArr[0])
fmt.Println(&intArr[1]) // +4
fmt.Println(&intArr[2]) // +4

intArr := [...]int32{1, 2, 3}
```

slices are just wrappers around arrays

```go
var intSlice []int32 = []int32{4, 5, 6}
fmt.Println(intSlice)
intSlice = append(intSlice, 7)
fmt.Println(intSlice)

len() and cap() 

var myMap map[string]uint8 = make(map[string]uint8)
```

```
for i<10{

}

for i, v := range intArrP{

}

for i:=0, 
```

Strings

Structs
```go
type gasEngine struct{
	mpg uint8
	gallons uint8
	
}

myEngine gasEngine = gasEngine{25, 15}
type ___ struct { 
	name string
	int <- nested
}

// methods
func (e gasEngine) milesLeft() uint8 {
	return e.gallons*empg
}
```
 
Interface: just need same type and methods 
```
type engine interface { 

}
```

Pointers: 
type, which store memory addresses (that's all)

```go
func main(){
	var p *int32 = new(int32)
	var i int32
}

//0x means: about to be hexadecimal
32 bit or 64 bit, 4 or 8 depending on system, 
```

\* means CREATE POINTER (DOUBLE SOMETHING)
\* means SET THE VALUE AT THE MEMORY LOCATION THIS POINTER POINTERS TO 

a memory address must be assigned (malloced) to the pointer

`&i` refers to the memory address of `i` not it's value. 

pass by reference or pass by value

![[Pasted image 20240108232116.png]]

```go
myLiat = [5]uint32{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

Concurrency â‰  Parallel Execution (all the time)
- multiple tasks in progress (can switch from task, if one is loading)
- parallel execution is having 2 cpu cores wokring on both tasks

```go
func myFunc(){

}


go myFunc()
```

WaitGroups are just counters. Whenever you spawn a new go routine, add 1 to the counter, then decremtent with wg.Done() 

wg.Wait() wait till it's 0. it's a stack. 
multiple thread s modifying same memory location at once
