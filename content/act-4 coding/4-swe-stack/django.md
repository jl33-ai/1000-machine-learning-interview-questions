'Batteries included' = comes with a lot of features in the box, e.g:
- admin site
- object relational mapper (ORM) abstracts the database for us, for low-code 
- Authentication
- Caching

Web application basics: 
- Front-end (the part loaded on web browser on client machine)
- Back-end (the part runs on server, data processing, validating business rules)

URL = uniform resouce locator - locate resource on internet
resource = 
- page 
- image 
- video
- pdf

**Client -> Server**
- serve processes request, returns response
- Communicate in Hypertext Transfer Protocol
For each page, browser sends http request, recieved http response

Back end is how do we respond? 
- the html page (HTML = hypertext markup language)
- or just the data
	- APPLICATION MORE SCALABLE 

Creating web pages on client 
- react
- angular 
- vue

Server tools for backend
- django
- asp.net core
- express

Serve becomes just gateway to the data
On serve, we provide endpoints to the data
e.g 
- /products
- /orders
All these endpoints together consitute the APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
(buttons on the remote control). Remote control for TV = API

Plain JS, react etc constitute the FRONT END which talks to our django API.
