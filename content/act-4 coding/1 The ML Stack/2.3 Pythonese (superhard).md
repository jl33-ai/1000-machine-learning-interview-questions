##### What is a `float64`

```python
#   Column          Non-Null Count   Dtype 
--- ------          --------------   ----- 
0   fixed acidity   1599 non-null    float64
```

Used to represent **real numbers** (numbers with whole and decimal parts), using **64** bits.

##### How can you keep track of a variable across recursive function calls

Using a list (`index = [1]`) to keep track of the count is a clever way to handle the mutable state across recursive calls. However, it's not immediately obvious why a list is being used here instead of a simple integer. This could confuse someone not familiar with Python's handling of mutable default arguments.
