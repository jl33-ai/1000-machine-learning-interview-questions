Everything in Python is an object. 

- Classes are templates for objects.
- Objects are instances of classes.
- Methods are functions assigned to classes

##### What is an `AttributeError` ?

>[!check] AttributeError
>In Python, an `AttributeError` is raised when you try to access or assign an attribute that does not exist for a particular object. The term "attribute" in Python typically refers to any name following a dot (`.`), and it can represent a method (a function associated with an object) or a property (a value associated with an object).

Basically, it says "this object does not have that method or variable associated with it."

<br>

---
##### What happens if you run `.sort()` on a string? 

This will raise an 'Attribute error' since string in Python are immutable. 

<br>

##### ↳ What do you mean "strings are immutable"?

>[!check] Immutable
> - The term "immutable" refers to an object whose state cannot be modified after it has been created. 
> - This is for memory efficiency and safety reasons.

##### Explain the following: declaring a variable, initializing a variable, defining a variable. 


statement, expression, control structure. 

- **Declaring a Variable:** Declaring a variable means stating its type and name, so the program knows what kind of data it will store, e.g., `int number;`.
- **Initializing a Variable:** Initializing a variable involves assigning it an initial value at the time of its declaration, e.g., `int number = 5;`.
- **Statement:** A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action, typically ending with a semicolon, e.g., `int x = 10;`.
- **Expression:** An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that can be evaluated to produce another value, e.g., `5 * (x + 3)`.
- **Control Structure:** in programming is a block of code that dictates the flow of program execution, based on specified conditions or loops. E.g: `if`, `else`, `for loop`.

##### Q4) **Evaluate the following logical expression over $x$** 

`f(x) = (0<=x & x<=1)*x + (1<x & x<=2)*(2-x) + 0`

- If $x$ is between 0 and 1, then `(0<=x & x<=1)` will evaluate to `1` and the function will be `f(x) = x`
- If $x$ is between 1 and 2, then `(1<x & x<=2)` will evaluate to `1` and the function will be `f(x) = 2-x`

###### What is an idempotent operator

<br>

---

###### `sorted()` vs ``.sort()`

This demonstrates your uinderstanding of the nuances of pythonic programming, as well as the fundamental nature of methods and functions, and how they behave (what they return vs. what they actually do)

---

###### What would this function return?

```python
def mysteryReturn(a: int, b: str) -> ?
	print('I am a mysterious function')
	c = str(a) + b
```

It would return `None`, as this is the default return value in Python. 

<br>


---

###### In Python, what does the `None` object represent? 

`None` is a special constant in Python, signifying 'nothing' or 'no value'. It is the only instance of the `NoneType`.

<br>

###### ↳ What is the default return value of a Python function that doesn't explicitly return anything?

Such a function returns `None`.

<br>
###### ↳ How does Python treat `None` in a boolean context?

In boolean contexts, `None` is considered `False`.

<br>
###### ↳ `None` is a singleton - True or false?

True! There is only one instance of `None` in a Python runtime. 

<br>
###### ↳ Should you use `is None` or `== None`

- `==` operator checks for **equality** in value.
- `is` checks for identity - if a variable points to the same memory location as `None`
	- In this case, `None` is an object in memory

<br>
###### ↳ What happens under the hood when `node is not None` is evaluated

<br>

###### ↳ What happens when you compare two variables both assigned to `None` using `==`?

```python
a = None
b = None
result = (a == b)
```

It returns `True`. Both `a` and `b` refer to the same `None` object, making them equal in value.

<br>
###### ↳ What is the preferred way to check if a variable is `None` in Python?

Using `is None` is recommended, as it checks for identity, i.e whether two variables actually point to the same object in memory, as opposed to just being equal in **value**. 

<br>
###### ↳ What does `a = None` do in terms of object reference?

It makes `a` refer to the singleton `None` object in Python's runtime environment.

<br>

---

###### What type is `'33'` in Python?

It's a `str` (string) type because it's enclosed in quotes.

<br>
###### ↳ And without quotes, what type is `33` in Python?

It's an `int` (integer) type.

<br>
###### ↳ What Python concept does this difference illustrate?

It illustrates Python's dynamic typing and literal interpretation based on syntax (quotes for strings, no quotes for integers).

<br>

---

###### ↳ Seeing this function, the `+` operator is known as what? 

Overloaded! It works on many different types, not just integers. 

<br>

###### ↳ How does Python handle the expression `3 + 4` under the hood?

```python
result = 3 + 4
```

Python internally calls the `__add__` method of the first integer, effectively doing `(3).__add__(4)`.

<br>

###### ↳ What is the term for methods like `__add__` in Python?

- They are known as **magic methods** or **dunder** (double underscore) methods. 
- They are called by Python's own syntax and built-in functions. 
- Normal methods are called explicitly by the programmer such as: `object.method()`


<br>

###### ↳ Can you overload the `+` operator for a custom class in Python?

Yes, by defining the `__add__` method in your custom class, you can control how `+` behaves with its instances. All you would have to do is: 

```python
class Point:
	 def __init__(self, x, y):
		 self.x = x
		 self.y = y
	 def __add__(self, other):
		 return self.x + other.y + 3
```

<br>

###### ↳ Imagine you want to sabotage the company. How would you edit this class so that when you try to cast it to a string with `str(myPoint)`, it returns the phrase `"prank sinatra!"`

```python
# Add this method:
	def __str__(self):
		return "prank sinatra!"
```

##### What would the output of the following program be? 

```python
class StringProcessor:
    def __init__(self, s):
		print('Initialised')

    def reverse_string(self):
        return s[::-1]

processor = StringProcessor('Molly')
processor.reverse_string()
```

It would output: `NameError: name 's' is not defined` since the variable `s` is not defined within the scope of the `reverse_string` method. You need to assign `s` to a **[[member variable]]**

<br>
##### ↳ How would you fix this? 


```python
class StringProcessor:
    def __init__(self, s):
		print('Initialised')
		self.s = s

    def reverse_string(self):
        return self.s[::-1]
```

This stores the value of `s` as an instance variable, making it accessible to other methods within the class as `self.s`.

##### Articulate the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`.

##### In Python, is it `.sum()` or `sum()`

The default Python implementation of a list does not have a `.sum()` method, and instead you just 

<br>

##### When would it be `.sum()?` 

If you were dealing with an **object** of a specific **class** which happened to have a `.sum()` **method**.

For example: the **array** data structure from the [[NumPy]] **Library**: 

```python
import numpy as np

my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = my_array.sum()
print(result)  # This will print 15, which is the sum of the elements in the NumPy array.
```

<br>

##### What about finding the maximum of an array, is it `.max()` or `max()`?

☞ Similarly, the `.max()` method is not a built-in method for standard Python lists or tuples.

☞ However, it is a method provided by some libraries and data structures, such as NumPy.

☞ The **takeaway** is that it can be confusing! Don't be discouraged if you sometimes can't remember these small implementation details.
