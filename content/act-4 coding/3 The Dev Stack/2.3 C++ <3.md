##### Sexyiness

```cpp
std::cout << "hello world" << std::endl;
```

I mean how sexy is this. You're *inserting* words into the stream



Knowing another language is good. 

C++ is a compiler based, low level, object oriented programming language

But seriously, we've covered python for ML, we've covered algorithms, C++ will be used to cover the rest of computer science basics, due to being a more low level language (closer to machine code, but not quite as close as other languages)

Python tends to be more concise and higher-level, while C++ provides more control and efficiency, especially for system-level programming. 

We'll cover stuff like the heap vs the stack, pointers, memory management, typing.

it's good if you want to be that applicant who also really gets computer science + knows another languagfe, and is a bit more of a programmer than a scripter. 

Python was made for Machine Learning. 
But for ***programming***... we return to our true love: C++. 
Note: this is obviously just a personal preference. There are many low-level programming languages to choose from; C, C++, C#, Rust... 

- I mean `long long`? Sold.

- bits, bytes
- what the compiler is 
- operating systems 101
- hexadecimal

##### Please write a C++ program to print `hello world` to the console. 

```cpp
# include <iostream>

int main () {
	std::cout << "hello world";
}
```

<br>

##### ↳ Why does every C++ program need a `main ()` function? 

☞ `main ()` is just the first function to be called by default. It provides an **entry point** to the program, once it is executed from the runtime environment.

☞ From this entry point, the rest of the program emerge. 

☞ This is sort of a universal convention across all programming languages. 

☞ The `main ()` function facilitates interaction with the operating system (OS), because when the program finishes executing, the `main ()` function returns `0` if everything went well, and any other return value signals that something may have gone wrong. 

<br>

##### ↳ What parameters does `main ()` have? 

☞ `main ()` can accept the command line arguments `argc` and `argv`, if given. 

☞ `argc`: The **count** (number) of arguments given.

☞ `argv`: The arguments themselves, as a **vector**.


> [!check] Command Line Arguments
> - Command line arguments are simply arguments which come from the command line, when the program is initially run, in the exact same way you would supply a function with arguments when calling it. 
> - This allows the program to receive input parameters from the user/environment it is being run in. 
> - See here for [[2.2 Pythonese (easy)#Articulate the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`.|parameters vs arguments]]. 

<br>

##### ↳ How would you define the `main ()` function to accept command line arguments? 

```cpp
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
```

<br>

##### ↳ What is `char *argv[]`?

In this context, `argv` stands for 'argument vector (array)', and is itself an array of pointers, where each pointer pointers to an array of characters (a string).

This could written equivalently as `char** argv`, which makes it clear that `argv` is a pointer to a pointer to `char`. 

<br>

---

##### What's a pointer? 

If you can't answer this, watch [this](https://youtu.be/YgCq0Y6Mhh0?si=1mbaf7HA2CheYLz6&t=79).



---

##### Classes vs Structs

<br>

---

##### What is a member in C++? 

> [!check] Member
> Members are the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) of a class. 

<br>

---
##### What are the three main access specifiers in C++?

> [!check] **Public**
> Attributes or methods declared as '`public`' are accessible from outside the class. 
> They can be accessed or modified. 

> [!check] **Private**
> Attributes or methods declared as '`private`' are only accessible within the class itself. 
> They cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class, which is crucial for encapsulation, allowing the class to control the integrity of its internal state.

> [!check] **Protected**
> Attributes or methods declared as '`protected`' are similar to private, but they can also be accessed in derived classes. 
> This means that while they are not accessible directly from outside the class or unrelated functions, subclasses that inherit from the class have access to them. This specifier is often used in inheritance to ensure a level of protection while still allowing functionality in child classes.

<br>

###### Rewrite the expression `myNode->val` using `*` and `.`

This is equivalent to `(*myNode).val`

<br>

##### What is a constructor in C++?

A constructor is a member function that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. 

For example, let's say you want to create a 'fruit' class


<br>

---

##### What does this output? 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main () {
	int pi; 
	std::cout << pi; 
}
```

The output of this program is unpredictable, since the variable `pi` has been declared but not initialized with a value yet. 

One potential output: 
```cpp
>>> 334201973
```

It could print any arbitrary integer value, or it could potentially cause a runtime error, depending on what is currently in the areas of memory where `pi` is allocated.

<br>

##### What is a 32-bit integer? How are integers stored in computer memory?  

Cmon, you're a data scientist. This is data in it's most pure digital form. 

Integers in computer memory are represented using a binary number system, where bits are either `0` or `1`. 

1. **Binary Representation:** A 32-bit integer is represented using 32 binary digits (0s and 1s).
    
2. **Range of Values:**
    
    - **Signed 32-bit Integer:** If the integer is signed (can represent both positive and negative values), it typically uses the two's complement notation. The range of values it can represent is from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. The most significant bit (MSB) is used as the sign bit. If the MSB is 0, the number is positive; if it's 1, the number is negative.
    - **Unsigned 32-bit Integer:** If the integer is unsigned (can only represent non-negative values), it can represent values from 0 to 4,294,967,295. All 32 bits are used for the value, allowing for a wider positive range than signed integers.
3. **Memory Usage:** Each 32-bit integer consumes 4 bytes (32 bits / 8 bits per byte) of memory.

<br>

##### ↳ How many different values can 8 bits represent? 

$2^8 = 256$ however this is the number of ***different values***; $0$ is included. 

<br>

##### ↳ What is the largest number that can be represented by 8 bits? 

**Unsigned Integers:** `255` (since the maximum binary number would be `1111 1111 = 255`)

**Signed Integers**: `127`

☞ Signed integers can go from: `[-128, 127]` with 8 bits. 
☞ In this case, one bit is used to represent the **sign** (`positive/negative`)

> [!check] Two's complement representation (for signed integers)
> 1. Represent the number in binary as if it were positive. 
> 2. For **negative** numbers only, flip each bit, so that `0` becomes `1`
> 3. Then add 1 to the number, e.g `10000000 -> 10000001`
> 4. Given that you followed the steps, the first bit will be `0` if the number is positive, and `1` if negative.
> 5. Two's compliment is the number that comes after the first bit, and an easy way to remember it, is it is the number you need to add to the positive version (7 bits), to get to $2^8$ (for 8 bit integers)

So then how do you *read* negative binary numbers? 
You flip all the bits then add 1. It's the same process. 



<br>

###### ↳ Explain how to convert the binary number `101011` into a decimal (normal base 10) number. 

**Going from left to right:**

$1 \times 2^0$
$1 \times 2^1$
$0 \times 2^2$
$1 \times 2^3$
$0 \times 2^4$
$1 \times 2^5$

<br>

###### ↳ What's the largest number that can be represented by 32 bits (an `int32` datatype)

Following the rule, $32$ bits can represent $2^{32}$ different values, and thus the largest number able to be represented is $2^{32}-1$, since we must reserve `00000...000` for the value of `0`. 

<br>


###### ↳ When would you use a smaller datatype? 

- Hyperperformant system
- If you know the max size of the number at [[# What is the difference between runtime and compile time? |compile time]]. 

<br>



Unless you have a good reason to, stick to the following types:

- `bool`
- `string`
- `int`
- `uint32`
- `byte`
- `rune`
- `float64`
- `complex128`

##### WHEN SHOULD I USE A MORE SPECIFIC TYPE?

When you're super concerned about performance and memory usage.

That’s about it. The only reason to deviate from the defaults is to squeeze out every last bit of performance when you are writing an application that is resource-constrained. (Or, in the special case of `uint64`, you need an absurd range of unsigned integers).

You can [read more on this subject here](https://blog.boot.dev/golang/default-native-types-golang/) if you'd like, but it's not required.

##### Translate `0x7fc3c16c5082` into decimal.

**0x**: This prefix indicates that the number following it is in hexadecimal format.

1. Break into digits
   - `7, f, c, 3, c, 1, 6, c, 5, 0, 8, 2`

2. Convert each hexadecimal digit to its decimal equivalent:
   - `7, 15, 12, 3, 12, 1, 6, 12, 5, 0, 8, 2`
   (Note: In hexadecimal, 'a'=10, 'b'=11, 'c'=12, 'd'=13, 'e'=14, 'f'=15)

3. Multiply each decimal digit by `16` raised to the power of its position index, starting from the right (position 0):
   - $7 \times 16^{11}$
   - $15 \times 16^{10}$
   - $12 \times 16^9$
   - $3 \times 16^8$
   - $12 \times 16^7$
   - $1 \times 16^6$
   - $6 \times 16^5$
   - $12 \times 16^4$
   - $5 \times 16^3$
   - $0 \times 16^2$
   - $8 \times 16^1$
   - $2 \times 16^0$

4. Add up all these values to get the final decimal number.

$7 \times 16^{11} + 15 \times 16^{10} + 12 \times 16^9 + 3 \times 16^8 + \dots + 8 \times 16^1 + 2 \times 16^0$




<br>

##### How many bits are in a byte? 

> [!check] Byte
> A bit is the smallest unit of computing. One **byte** is made up of 8 bits. 

<br>


---

##### What is the difference between a class and struct in `C++`?

They are functionally equivalent in `C++`, however: 

- **Struct**
	- In a **struct**, members are **public** by default. 
	- Primary purpose is to hold data
- **Class**
	- In a **class**, members are **private** by default. 
	- Used for **objects** with more complex behaviour, encapsulating both functions and data

*Both have constructors, destructors, member functions and support inheritance and polymorphism.*

##### Class hierarchy for a zoo 
> Imagine you're designing software for a zoo to monitor and track different types of animals. Using `C++`, create a class hierarchy that represents various animals in the zoo. You should start with a base class '*Animal*'. The base class should have common attributes like 'name', 'age', 'weight', and a method to display these attributes. 

```python
class Animal {
protected:
    std::string name;
    int age;
    double weight;

public:
    Animal(std::string n, int a, double w) : name(n), age(a), weight(w) {}

    virtual void display() {
        std::cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << ", Weight: " << weight << " kg" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

###### ⚘ Now, explain how you can use [[2.2 Object Oriented Programming#^73eb37|polymorphism]] to derive a 'Fish' type

Since we have specified the base class `Animal` we can use polymorphism to extend our hierarchy. Let's derive a 'Fish' class from 'Animal'

```python
class Fish : public Animal { // inherit from Animal
	std::string waterType;   // std::string is a string in the standard namespace

public:
	Fish(std::string n, int a, double w, std::string wt) : Animal(n, a, w), waterType(wt) {}
	
	void swim() {
		std::cout << name << " is swimming!" << std::endl;
	}

	void display() override {
		std::cout << "Fish - ";
		Animal::display();
		std::cout << "Water Type: " << waterType <, std::endl;
	}
};
```

<br>

##### The Stack vs. The Heap


<br>

---

##### Automatic allocation vs. Dynamic allocation 

> [!check] Automatic allocation (stack)
> **Definition**: Automatic allocation occurs when memory for variables is allocated on the stack at the moment the variable is declared. The memory is automatically managed: it's allocated when entering the scope where the variable is declared and deallocated when leaving that scope.
> - **Advantage**: No manual memory management required.
> - **Disadvantage**: Limited to the scope of the block in which it's declared.

```cpp
void function() {
    int a = 5; // 'a' is automatically allocated on the stack
} // 'a' is automatically deallocated here
```
In this example, `a` is an automatic variable allocated on the stack. Its lifespan is tied to the `function`'s scope.

<br>

> [!check] Dynamic allocation (heap)
> **Definition**: Dynamic allocation is the manual allocation of memory during runtime, typically on the heap. It is done using `new` in C++, and the allocated memory remains until it's explicitly deallocated with `delete`.
> - **Advantage**: Allows for dynamic and persistent memory management.
> - **Disadvantage**: Requires manual handling, potential for memory leaks.

```cpp
int* ptr = new int(10); // Dynamically allocate an integer on the heap
// Use 'ptr'
delete ptr; // Manually deallocate the memory
```
Here, `ptr` is a pointer to an integer allocated on the heap. Its lifespan is not limited to a particular scope and must be manually managed.

<br>

> [!check] TLDR
> Automatic allocation is easy and scope-bound with auto-cleanup, while dynamic allocation offers flexibility and persistence but needs careful memory management.

If you try to use `curr_node.next` in your code, where `curr_node` is a pointer to a `ListNode`, it would result in a compilation error in C++. This is because the dot operator (`.`) is used for accessing members of a structure or class when you have an actual object (or a reference to an object), not a pointer to an object.

In your code, `curr_node` is declared as a pointer to a `ListNode`:

```cpp
ListNode* curr_node = head;
```

Given that `curr_node` is a pointer, you must use the arrow operator (`->`) to access its members. The correct way to access the `next` member of the `ListNode` pointed to by `curr_node` is `curr_node->next`.

If `curr_node` were not a pointer but an actual `ListNode` object or a reference to a `ListNode` object, then you would use the dot operator. For example, if you had the following:

```cpp
ListNode aNode;
```

In this case, `aNode` is an object, not a pointer. So, you would use `aNode.next` to access its `next` member.

##### `do {}, while ()`

Identical to a while loop, but the **first iteration** of the loop is guaranteed to run.

##### What is the difference between `&` and `&&`?

`&` is a **bitwise AND operator**. 

```cpp
int a = 5;  // binary representation: 0101
int b = 9;  // binary representation: 1001
int result = a & b;  // result is 1, binary representation: 0001
```

`&&` is a **logical AND operator**.

```cpp
bool x = true;
bool y = false;
if (x && y) {
    // This block will not execute because y is false.
}
```

##### How to find the length of a string in C++?

```cpp
string s = "ruhroh"
// In this context, both functions are identical
s.size()
s.length()
```

In the code snippet you provided, `int myInt = i + 3;` is inside the loop block of the `for` loop. Here's what happens:

1. **Scope of `myInt`:** The variable `myInt` is declared inside the loop, which means it has a local scope to each iteration of the loop. Its existence is limited to a single iteration of the loop.

2. **Creation and Destruction:** On each iteration of the loop, `myInt` is indeed created anew. When each iteration ends, `myInt` goes out of scope and is destroyed. Then, on the next iteration, a new `myInt` is created.

3. **Memory Efficiency:** Modern compilers are quite efficient, and they may optimize this kind of code under the hood. The creation and destruction of `myInt` on each iteration are typically very fast and not a significant performance concern in most cases. However, if the variable does not need to be reinitialized each time and can maintain its value between iterations, it's often better practice to declare it outside the loop to avoid potential confusion and to make the intent of the code clearer.

Also, note that there's a typo in your loop: `for (int i=0; I<5; I++)` should be `for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)` with lowercase 'i' for consistency.

##### Doesn't work as in Python

```cpp
int alpha, beta;
alpha, beta = x, y;
```

- The statement `alpha, beta = x, y;` does not correctly assign the values of `x` to `alpha` and `y` to `beta`. In C++, the comma operator `,` has the lowest precedence and is a sequence point. This statement is equivalent to `(alpha), (beta = x), (y);`. What happens here is:
    - `alpha` is evaluated and the result is discarded.
    - `beta` is assigned the value of `x`.
    - `y` is evaluated and the result is discarded.
- Therefore, after this statement, `beta` will have the value of `x`, but `alpha` will remain unchanged.
