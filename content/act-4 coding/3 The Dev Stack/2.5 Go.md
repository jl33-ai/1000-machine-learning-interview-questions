- NATIVELY COMPILED LANGUAGE; straight to machine code. 
- C sharp and java are compiled in a virtual environemtn?

Doesn't run as fast as other compiled, but compiles (builds) more quickly

##### `package main`

##### How do you print? 

```go
import "fmt"
fmt.Println("hey world")
```

##### Go code generally runs ____ than interpreted languages and compiles ____ than other compiled languages like C and Rust

##### 

`main.go` -> `go build` -> `myprogram.exe`

- can run the executable without having Go, doesn't even know was made with Go. 
- Different to python - need python interpreter

##### On bootdev

- Code gets shipped to serve, compiled, run. 
- Compiler vs. Runtime error

processors are not chatGPT< they need machine code. 

how to distribute python code vs. compiled code

`main.py` (interpreted) - give your friend `main.py` and on their computer they run `python main.py`
friend needs python installed on computer (dependent)  - need to know how to use a command line

`main.go` -> compile, then you can sell, without giving away the source code. 

##### Do users of compiled programs need acess to source code? (Hypotheticals) - Mai
