- NATIVELY COMPILED LANGUAGE; straight to machine code. 
- C sharp and java are compiled in a virtual environemtn? 

![[compiling.png]]

Doesn't run as fast as other compiled, but compiles (builds) more quickly

##### `package main`

##### How do you print? 

```go
import "fmt"
fmt.Println("hey world")
```

##### Go code generally runs ____ than interpreted languages and compiles ____ than other compiled languages like C and Rust

##### 

`main.go` -> `go build` -> `myprogram.exe`

- can run the executable without having Go, doesn't even know was made with Go. 
- Different to python - need python interpreter

##### On bootdev

- Code gets shipped to serve, compiled, run. 
- Compiler vs. Runtime error

processors are not chatGPT< they need machine code. 

how to distribute python code vs. compiled code

`main.py` (interpreted) - give your friend `main.py` and on their computer they run `python main.py`
friend needs python installed on computer (dependent)  - need to know how to use a command line

`main.go` -> compile, then you can sell, without giving away the source code. 

##### Do users of compiled programs need acess to source code? (Hypotheticals) - Mai


- compiled binaries are good (also in servers)
- strong and static typing
	- when you declare a string = "wagslane" can't accidentally be changed later 
	- we find bugs in compilation instead of running (compile time error)

Drums in the background. 

- can do operatioin with consts as long as they can be known at compile time.

##### Function signature: `func concat(a string, b string) string {`

strongly vs statically typed

- **Strong vs Weak Typing:**
    
    - Strongly typed languages enforce strict type rules, making implicit type conversions rare.
    - Weakly typed languages allow more flexibility in type handling, often performing implicit type conversions.
- **Static vs Dynamic Typing:**
    
    - Statically typed languages require variable types to be declared at compile-time.
    - Dynamically typed languages determine variable types at runtime, and type checking is performed during execution.

Camel case vs. snake case
	Callback: a function that can be passed to another function to be called later. 

`func f(g func(int, int) int, n int) int`

`f func(func(int, int) int, int) int`



Memory: 


by value (unless explicitly..) vs. by reference

- **GO does not allow unused variables**

- implicit naked returns = bad

- named returns 

early returns / gaurd clauses
- they provide a linear approach to lgic trees. 

`nil` `error`

heuristic used by developers

- struct is first of the collection types: a type that contains other types. 
	- dictionairy

```go
type car struct {
	Make string
	Model string
	Height int 
	Width int
	FrontWheel Wheel
} 
```
