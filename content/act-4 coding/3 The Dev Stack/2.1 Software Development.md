##### `GET` and `POST`

In web development, GET and POST are two common methods used to send requests to a server. The way parameters are written in these requests is different for each method:

1. **GET Requests:**
   - Parameters in GET requests are appended to the URL.
   - Each parameter is added to the URL with a '?' symbol followed by the parameter name and value, separated by an '=' sign.
   - Multiple parameters are separated by the '&' symbol.
   - Example URL with GET parameters: `http://example.com/page?param1=value1&param2=value2`

2. **POST Requests:**
   - Parameters in POST requests are included in the body of the request, not in the URL.
   - They are often sent as a part of an HTTP message body, using the same key-value pair format as GET parameters.
   - The content type of the request (e.g., `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`) determines the format of these parameters.
   - Unlike GET requests, POST parameters are not visible in the URL and have no length restrictions, making them more secure and capable of handling large amounts of data.

The choice between GET and POST methods depends on the requirements of the application, particularly in terms of data size, security, and the idempotency of the request.

##### Compilation/Execution

`main.go`
Human readable format (code)

Computer itself only understands one language: binary, and add/subtract

Compilation: process of `human readable code` -> `machine code` (binary) that computer can understand
