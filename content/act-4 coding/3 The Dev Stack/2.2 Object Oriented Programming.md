What are the paradigms (easy) 
###### 1. I can see on your resume that you've listed OOP as a strength. Would you be able to explain to me, in your own words, what Object-Oriented Programming is?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures containing data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.

###### What is the object oriented paradigm

The core philosophy of OOP revolves around designing software around objects, rather than functions and logic. It emphasizes modularity, reusability, and organization of code through the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

###### 3. How Does OOP Differ From Procedural Programming?
OOP differs from procedural programming in that it organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. In procedural programming, the program is structured as a sequence of procedures or functions, whereas, in OOP, programs are structured as a collection of interacting objects.

###### 4. What Do You Find Most Beneficial About Using OOP?
(Here, you would share your personal experiences and views on the benefits of using OOP, such as improved code maintainability, ease of understanding, reusability, etc.)

<br>

---

###### 5. Do You Prefer OOP Over Other Programming Paradigms? Why or Why Not?
(Express your personal preference, if any, for OOP over other programming paradigms, and explain the reasons for your preference, such as clarity in object modeling, ease of debugging, etc.)

###### 6. What are Classes and Objects in OOP?
Classes are blueprints for creating objects, defining a type by bundling data and methods. Objects are instances of those classes, representing entities with the defined characteristics and behaviors of their class.

<br>

---

###### 7. Can You Explain Encapsulation in OOP?
Encapsulation is about bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, or class, and controlling the access to that data, typically through access modifiers like private and public.

<br>

---

###### 8. You mentioned Access Modifiers, what are they?
Access modifiers, such as `public`, `private`, and `protected`, define the access scope of class members. `Public` members are accessible from anywhere, while `private` members are accessible only within the class itself.

<br>

---

###### 9. How Does Inheritance Work in OOP?
Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. It facilitates code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent (base) and child (derived) classes.

<br>

---

###### 10. Define Polymorphism in OOP.

^73eb37

Polymorphism in OOP is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class, mainly through interfaces or inherited classes. It often involves method overriding. ^78b0e5

<br>

---

###### 11. What is Abstraction in OOP?
Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary functionalities of an object. It simplifies the interface that the object presents to the outside world.

<br>

---

###### 12. What are Constructors and Destructors?
Constructors are special methods used to initialize new objects, while destructors are used to clean up and release resources before an object is destroyed.

<br>

---

###### 13. Explain Method Overloading and Overriding.
Method overloading is creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. Method overriding involves redefining a method in a derived class that already exists in the base class.

<br>

---

###### 14. What are Interfaces and Abstract Classes?
Interfaces are contracts that define what a class can do, without providing the implementation. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and often contain abstract methods.

<br>

---

###### 15. Describe Composition in OOP.
Composition is a design principle where a class is made up of one or more objects of other classes, allowing it to reuse functionalities of the included objects.

<br>

---

###### 16. Differentiate Between Association, Aggregation, and Composition.
Association represents a general relationship between objects. Aggregation is a specialized form of association where objects have a whole-part relationship. Composition is a strong form of aggregation where the part cannot exist independently of the whole.

<br>

---

###### 17. What are Static Members in a Class?
Static members belong to the class rather than any individual instance. They are shared by all instances of the class, ensuring that there's a common **value** or behavior shared across them.
