# Why doing Leetcodes is worth it

As companies try to level the playing field for penultimate-year students who may not have even touched a statistics textbook yet, they need a more standardized way to measure aptitude. 

This often comes in the form of general [[math]], [[statistics]], and [[probability]] questions, as well as programming skills and algorithmic thinking. 

Here, we cover the latter. 

> [!check] ML Algorithms
> Machine learning algorithms aim to most **effectively** exploit information in the data, and patterns, in order to yield the most accurate output. 

> [!check] Algorithms
> Normal algorithms aim to most **efficiently** exploit information in the data. E.g Binary Search exploits the fact that the data is sorted. You can test this on [any Leetcode](); the optimal solution will always be the one that exploits the most information in the data.

This section emphasizes the importance of programming fluency and algorithmic thinking for data scientists, offering a break from ML's probabilistic nature and strengthening core skills.

# Practical Leetcode Advice (for the average person)

### ***Getting set up***

1. Watch [this](https://youtu.be/BgLTDT03QtU?si=rpC7gzR6H2NUHeOD) if you don't understand time and space complexity. 
2. Remember to practice everything performant; how you type, explain. 
3. Check the constraints first (that section at the bottom). It's so easy, and will make you look like you know what you're doing. 
4. Don't panic. At first, the number of things they can test you on seems unlimited, but as you cover more ground, you realize that it is actually quite limited. 

<br>

### ***Puzzles, not code***

- This shift in mindset will take you far. 
- Almost all Leetcodes require some purely logical observation to be made first, which are completely independent to the way the code is written. 
- Leetcodes are more puzzles than code to be written. If you get too caught up with the fact that you need to write code, you will probably struggle.


<br>

### ***Where's your Leetcode notebook?***

- If you don't have one already, make one. You will immediately notice an improvement in how enjoyable Leetcodes become, as well as how quickly you crack them.

- Engaging your [visual cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex) helps, a lot. (For more rich mental [[embeddings]])
- Writing out pseudocode should feel like doing math by pen and paper. 

<br>

### ***Leetcodes can be addictive if you let them***

- Don't stress. Just enjoy the process of cracking the puzzle.

<br>

### ***Redo the ones you did a few weeks ago.***

- Leetcodes are a healthy balance of **1) exposure** and **2) repetition**. 
- Yes everyone just wants to see that number tick up. But at some point the input/value curve slows down....
- You actually get much more from redo'ing leetcodes: you understand them more deeply, you can actually redo them, and better. 
- At a certain point you get more out of repeating old ones than doing new ones. 
- That said, increasing your breadth gives you better odds in the interview.

- If you struggled with one yesterdya, do it again first thing in the morning; show it who's boss. 
<br>

### ***Don't check the answers.***

- If you can't figure it out, the best thing you can do is **give up**. Walk away, let the question stew in your head while you move onto something else. Let it marinate - or sit and think about it, whatever suits your style. 
- It's not really about getting the answer right, as it is sitting there and thinking about the answer. 
- Get comfy, play some calming [classical music](), and just enjoy the puzzle solving process, enjoy the brain teaser. 

<br>

### ***Check the answers.***

- It's okay to refer to sample solutions when you start out - it's a great way to learn, but as your ego increases, you will resent checking them even more. 
- If can't figure it out, use the hints provided by Leetcode in the `Description` section: 

![[Pasted image 20231229105115.png | 500]]

- If you **really** can't figure it out, don't go straight to the answers, instead, do this: 

```text
Me:
"Can you give me a hint for how to solve this (((WITHOUT GIVING AWAY THE ANSWER))): ... "

ChatGPT:
" ... "
```

<br>

### ***Improving.***

- Again, [[#***Redo the ones you did a few weeks ago.***|redo them]]. 
- A neat trick: Use the word '***roast***' - you will learn a lot from savage ChatGPT. 

**If you're unsure about your algorithm:** `"Roast my code"`

**If you're confident in your algorithm but unsure about your implementation:** `"Roast my algorithm"


<br>

### ***Be bilingual***

- Be bilingual: be able to complete any Leetcode in more than one language. Implementation is really not that different - most of the time it's only syntax you have to learn. 
- If you haven't already decided, *[[2.3 C++ <3|C++]]* is a good first choice. You can learn it [[2.3 C++ <3|here]]. 
- Knowing just one extra language immediately puts you ahead of the millions of people who already know [[2.2 Pythonese (easy)|Python]]
