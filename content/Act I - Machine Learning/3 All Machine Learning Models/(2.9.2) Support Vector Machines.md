##### What is a Support Vector Machine? 

> [!check] Non-Linearly Separable Data
> - The need for SVM's arises when dealing with non-linearly separable data - i.e data that you cannot draw a single straight line/plane through to separate into its classes.

##### What's the main idea?

1. Start with data in a relatively **[[1.2 Easy Questions#What is a 'dimension' of data in ML|low dimension]]**


<br>


![[svm-steps.svg|300]]


<br>


2. Transform the data into a **[[1.2 Easy Questions#What is a 'dimension' of data in ML|higher dimension]]**

<br>


![[svm-steps-3.svg|300]]

<br>

3. Find a **[[(2.9.1) Support Vector Classifiers|Support Vector Classifiers]]** that separates the higher dimensional data into two groups

###### ↳ Is it a supervised or unsupervised machine learning model?

They are definitely supervised. The decision boundary is derived directly from the training data. 



<br>

###### ↳ Are they only useful for classification? 


No! They can also be used for regression *(more on this later)*.

##### What type of data are SVM's well suited for classifying? 

**Support Vector Machines** are also good for classifying: 
☞ Data that a neural net would overfit
☞ High dimensional data
☞ Non-linear data, using [[(2.9.2) Support Vector Machines#What do you do if|Kernel Tricks]]

##### Why would you use an SVM when neural networks exist? 

- If low amounts of high dimensional data.
- If it's data with clear segments, that neural nets are likely to overfit. 
- SVM's are lightweight whereas neural networks are computationally expensive.
- SVMs are simpler to implement and tune compared to neural networks, which require careful tuning of numerous hyperparameters and long training times.

##### What is the difference between a MMC, SVC, and a SVM? When should you use each? 

☞ **[[(2.9.1) Support Vector Classifiers#What is a Maximal Margin Classifier?|MMC]]:** If the data has no outliers or noise, and is linearly separable.
☞ **[[(2.9.1) Support Vector Classifiers|SVC]]:** If the data is linearly separable.
☞ **[[(2.9.2) Support Vector Machines#^What is a Support Vector Machine|SVM]]:** If the data is not linearly separable.

A point = a flat, affine, 0-dimensional subspace 

A hyperplace = a flat affine subspace. s
