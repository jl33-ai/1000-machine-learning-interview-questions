### High-level snapshot, in rough order of importance

Supervised Learning:
- Linear Regression (Simple, Supervised)
- Decision Trees (Moderate, Supervised)
- Random Forest (Moderate, Supervised)
- Support Vector Machines (Complex, Supervised)
- Neural Networks (Complex, Supervised)

Unsupervised Learning:
- K-Means Clustering (Moderate, Unsupervised)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Moderate, Unsupervised)
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) (Moderate, Unsupervised)
- Hierarchical Clustering (Moderate, Unsupervised)

Reinforcement Learning:
- Q-Learning (Moderate, Reinforcement)
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) (Complex, Reinforcement)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Complex, Reinforcement)

Each algorithm's position on the grid would roughly indicate its complexity and the type of learning it belongs to. Of course, this is an oversimplified representation, and there are many more algorithms and dimensions to consider in the real world of machine learning.

For a detailed and visually engaging exploration of machine learning algorithms

Fanciness **does not matter**. The **bottom line** is how well the model performs on the real data. 

We could try to fit a ***Convolutional Megatron Quantum Gradient Neural Network***, but if simple linear regression fits the data better, it is THE BETWR MODEL
