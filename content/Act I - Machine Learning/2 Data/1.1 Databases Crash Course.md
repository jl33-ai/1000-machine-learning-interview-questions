very roughly follow INFO20003

###### Q4) **BIT, BYTE, KB, MB, GB, TERA, PETA**

**`A bit is the most basic unit of digital data, serving as the foundation for all other data types. It is a contraction of "binary digit"`**
`Bit = 0 or Bit = 1`

A **byte** is simply **8 bits** `e.g 1001110` and can thus represent **$2^8 = 256$** distinct values

**1 Kilobyte** is equal to **1024 bytes** 
**1 Megabyte** is equal to **1024 Kilobytes**
**1 Gigabyte** is equal to **1024 Megabyte**
**1 Terabyte** is equal to **1024 Gigabytes**
**1 Petabyte** is equal to **1024 Terabytes**

>\* Note that this is using the binary system,  you may also just assume that **1 GB = 1000 MB** etc...
