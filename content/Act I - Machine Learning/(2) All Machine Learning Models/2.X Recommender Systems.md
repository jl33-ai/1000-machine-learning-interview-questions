More of an application than a specific model architecture, but commonly asked about enough to warrant their own section,. 

Recommender Systems are not a specific ML model but more a 'class' of ML systems, applied to a very valuable problem: predicting what to recommend to customers

##### What are the three ways to approach Recommender Systems? 

> [!check] Collaborative Filtering
> - Leverages user/product ratings to make guesses about the similarity of users/products, and recommend products accordingly
> - Can be user-based or item-based

> [!check] Content Based
> - Is based on the intrinsic qualities of content you are recommending (movies, songs, products)
> - E.g, **Spotify** might recommend you songs that sound similar. 

> [!check] Deep Learning Approaches
> - [[(0.1) Fundamentals|Deep learning]] models uncover complex, abstract patterns in user data, revealing nuanced preferences and behaviors.
> - Capable of identifying intricate relationships and hidden features in large datasets, beyond the reach of traditional algorithms.
> - Adapting to both explicit interactions and subtle, implicit user signals.
> - Enhance accuracy and relevance of recommendations by deeply understanding user profiles and item characteristics.

##### Explain the core logic behind item and user based [[2.X Recommender Systems#What are the three ways to approach Recommender Systems?|collaborative filtering]]

> [!check] Item based
> If items A and B were rated similarly by many users, then they are similar, and therefore someone who likes item A will probably also like item B. 

> [!check] User based
> If users A and B rated items similarly in the past, they will have similar preferences in the future.
