Each algorithm's position on the grid would roughly indicate its complexity and the type of learning it belongs to. Of course, this is an oversimplified representation, and there are many more algorithms and dimensions to consider in the real world of machine learning.

Aside: fanciness does not matter. The bottom line is how well the model performs on the testing (real) data. Example. We could use ***Convolutional Megatron Quantum Gradient Neural Network***, but if simple linear regression fits the data better, it is THE BETWR MODEL
