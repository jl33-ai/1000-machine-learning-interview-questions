All models are non-deterministic algorithms. (quote relevant)

Your **accuracy** must represent the problem at hand, and otherwise you can't really reliably gauge how 'accurate' model is. The data defines your interpretation of the quality of your algorithm/model. 

Both algorithms and machine learning algorithms should be made more robust by testing against or feeding more edge cases.
