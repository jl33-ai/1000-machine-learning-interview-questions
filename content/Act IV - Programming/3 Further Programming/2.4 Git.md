##### Have you used Git before? 

Yes/No

<br> 

---

##### Are **Git** and **Github** the same thing? 

No, but they are related. 

**Git** is a free and open source version control system (one of many).

> [!check] Version control
> - The tool that tracks the changes in your code over time
> - The management of changes to documents, programs, websites, and other information
> - Useful in software development, law, etc...
 
**Github** is a website
- Where you host your repositories online
- Allows you to collaborate 

<br>

> [!check] Definitions
> `directory -> Folder`
> `terminal/command line -> interface for text commands`
> `CLI -> command line interface` (think of it like a GUI for an application, but text-based. Instead of clicking buttons, you write commands) 
> `cd -> change directory` (the same thing as double clicking on a folder)
> `code editor -> a place where you can write code` (like MS word but for code)
> `repository -> project, or the folder where your project is kept`

##### Explain what each of these lines does: 

```
echo "# dsx-quartz" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jl33-ai/dsx-quartz.git
git push -u origin main
```

<br>

---

##### `clone`

> [!check] `git clone`
> - Copy and paste a repository that is hosted somewhere like Github, into a folder on your local machine

`git clone <repo_link>`

###### ↳ What is a 'shallow clone'?

<br>

---

##### `add`

> [!check] `git add`
> - Tell Git to keep track of these new files
> - Must be used before you can use `commit` to save changes
> - `git add .` stages **everything** (all files)
> - `git add my_file.html` would only give `my_file.html` to Git. 

<br>

---

##### `commit`

> [!check] `git commit`
> - Tell Git to **save** your files in Git
> - Only saves locally, not the same as **pushing**
> - `git commit -m <enter_message_here>`
> - `-m` stands for 'message'
> 	- The message should explain the **what and why** of the commit you are making. 
> - If you add a second `-m` it adds a description. 

<br>

---

##### `push`

> [!check] `git push`
> - Upload Git commits to a **remote repository**, such as Github


<br>

---

##### `pull`

> [!check] `git pull`
> - Download changes from remote repository to your local machine 
> - The opposite of push



<br>

---

##### `status`

> [!check] `git status`
> - Allows you to see all the all the files that have been updated, created or deleted, but have not yet been saved in a **commit**. 
> - You can see which changes have been **tracked** or are **untracked**, and which ones are ready to be committed. 

<br>

---

##### White, green, red meaning 

<br>

---

##### How do you check what version of git you are using

`git --version`

<br>

---

##### What is the `.git` directory

On mac you can use `la`, a proxy for `ls -la`, which allows you to list all files and directories inside your current directory. 

You should be able to see a hidden `.git` folder which essentially tracks all the changes and commits. 

<br>

---

##### What are SSH keys?

> [!check] SSH keys
> When trying to push to Github, in order to prove that you are actually the owner of the account, you need to connect your local machine to your Github account somehow. 
> This is done using SSH keys. 

###### ↳ Okay, how? 

`ssh-keygen` command with the arguments:
`-t` type of encryption `rsa`
`-b` strength of encryption `4096`
`-C` email address `example@email.com`
















##### How do you fork a **repository**? 

<br>

---

##### Are you familiar with various licenses? 

> [!check] MIT License (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 
> - Short, simple and permissive (permission granted)
> - Allows anyone to do whatever with your project, including making and distributing **closed source versions**


> [!check] GPL License (General Public License)
> - Lets people do almost anything they want with your project, **except distributing closed source versions.**

> [!check] BSD License (Berkeley Software Distribution)
> - More permissive than GPL, allowing **propritary use**
> - Can be included within proprietary products without inheriting the license

##### What would be the most appropriate license for X

Backing up your content

On branch v4

Your branch is ahead of 'origin/v4' by 3 commits.

  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

  

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Pulling updates from your repository. You may need to resolve some `git` conflicts if you've made changes to components or plugins.

Pushing your changes

what does '`git push origin main`' mean explain each word

1. **`git`**:
   - This is the command line tool for working with Git, a distributed version control system. 
   - It's the main command that starts off any Git operation.

2. **`push`**:
   - This is a Git subcommand. The `push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. It transfers commits from your local repository to the remote repository.

from:
3. **`origin`**:
   - This specifies the name of the remote repository where you're pushing your changes. By default, when you clone a repository, Git automatically names this remote repository `origin`. This is essentially a shorthand or an alias for the URL of the remote repository.

to: 
4. **`main`**:
   - This is the name of the branch you are pushing to on the remote repository. In this case, `main` is likely the default branch of the repository. It's the branch where your final, stable code lives. In older repositories or in certain contexts, this branch might be called `master`.

Certainly! Let's create a hypothetical scenario that will test your knowledge of Git, focusing on common tasks such as creating a branch, making changes, and merging those changes back into the main branch. Here's your scenario:

### Hypothetical Situation: Feature Development in Git

**Context**: You are working on a project called `AmazingProject`, which already has a Git repository initialized. Your task is to develop a new feature called `feature-awesome`.

**Tasks**:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Start by creating a new branch for developing your feature. The branch should be named `feature-awesome`.

2. **Make Changes**: In the `feature-awesome` branch, you are supposed to create a new file named `awesome.txt`. Add some content to it, for example, "This is an awesome feature!".

3. **Commit the Changes**: After making changes, you need to commit them to the `feature-awesome` branch. Make sure to write a descriptive commit message.

4. **Switch to the Main Branch**: Once you've committed your changes, switch back to the main branch of the repository. This is typically called `main` or `master`.

5. **Merge the Feature Branch**: Merge the `feature-awesome` branch into the main branch. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.

6. **Push Changes to Remote Repository**: Finally, push your changes from the local repository to the remote repository so that your team members can see the new feature.

### Questions:

- What commands would you use to accomplish each of these tasks in Git?
- If you encounter a merge conflict, how would you resolve it?
- How would you ensure that your `feature-awesome` branch is up-to-date with the main branch before merging?

This scenario tests basic Git operations like branching, committing, merging, and handling merge conflicts. It's a typical workflow for feature development in many software projects.
