##### Have you used Git before? 

<br> 


---

##### Are **Git** and **Github** the same thing? 

<br>

---

##### Explain what each of these lines does: 

```
echo "# dsx-quartz" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jl33-ai/dsx-quartz.git
git push -u origin main
```

<br>

##### How do you fork a **repository**? 

<br>

---

##### Are you familiar with various licenses? 

> [!check] MIT License (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 
> - Short, simple and permissive (permission granted)
> - Allows anyone to do whatever with your project, including making and distributing **closed source versions**


> [!check] GPL License (General Public License)
> - Lets people do almost anything they want with your project, **except distributing closed source versions.**

> [!check] BSD License (Berkeley Software Distribution)
> - More permissive than GPL, allowing **propritary use**
> - Can be included within proprietary products without inheriting the license

Backing up your content

On branch v4

Your branch is ahead of 'origin/v4' by 3 commits.

Â  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

  

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Pulling updates from your repository. You may need to resolve some `git` conflicts if you've made changes to components or plugins.

what does '`git push origin main`' mean explain each word

1. **`git`**:
   - This is the command line tool for working with Git, a distributed version control system. 
   - It's the main command that starts off any Git operation.

2. **`push`**:
   - This is a Git subcommand. The `push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. It transfers commits from your local repository to the remote repository.

from:
3. **`origin`**:
   - This specifies the name of the remote repository where you're pushing your changes. By default, when you clone a repository, Git automatically names this remote repository `origin`. This is essentially a shorthand or an alias for the URL of the remote repository.

to: 
4. **`main`**:
   - This is the name of the branch you are pushing to on the remote repository. In this case, `main` is likely the default branch of the repository. It's the branch where your final, stable code lives. In older repositories or in certain contexts, this branch might be called `master`.

Certainly! Let's create a hypothetical scenario that will test your knowledge of Git, focusing on common tasks such as creating a branch, making changes, and merging those changes back into the main branch. Here's your scenario:

### Hypothetical Situation: Feature Development in Git

**Context**: You are working on a project called `AmazingProject`, which already has a Git repository initialized. Your task is to develop a new feature called `feature-awesome`.

**Tasks**:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Start by creating a new branch for developing your feature. The branch should be named `feature-awesome`.

2. **Make Changes**: In the `feature-awesome` branch, you are supposed to create a new file named `awesome.txt`. Add some content to it, for example, "This is an awesome feature!".

3. **Commit the Changes**: After making changes, you need to commit them to the `feature-awesome` branch. Make sure to write a descriptive commit message.

4. **Switch to the Main Branch**: Once you've committed your changes, switch back to the main branch of the repository. This is typically called `main` or `master`.

5. **Merge the Feature Branch**: Merge the `feature-awesome` branch into the main branch. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise.

6. **Push Changes to Remote Repository**: Finally, push your changes from the local repository to the remote repository so that your team members can see the new feature.

### Questions:

- What commands would you use to accomplish each of these tasks in Git?
- If you encounter a merge conflict, how would you resolve it?
- How would you ensure that your `feature-awesome` branch is up-to-date with the main branch before merging?

This scenario tests basic Git operations like branching, committing, merging, and handling merge conflicts. It's a typical workflow for feature development in many software projects.
