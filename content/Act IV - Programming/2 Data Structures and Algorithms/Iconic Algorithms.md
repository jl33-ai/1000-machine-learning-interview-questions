When discussing famous real-world algorithms, it's important to consider those that have had a significant impact on various industries, technologies, and everyday life. Here are some notable examples:

**Scheduling**

**The 'would this fit in this'** one

**The String Search one**

1. **Google's PageRank Algorithm**: This is perhaps one of the most well-known algorithms in the world of the internet. Developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, PageRank was used by Google to rank web pages in their search engine results. It revolutionized the way information is retrieved online.

2. **RSA Encryption Algorithm**: RSA (named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) is a public-key cryptographic algorithm. It's widely used for secure data transmission and is a foundation for internet security.

3. **TCP/IP Protocols**: While not a single algorithm, TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It's fundamental to how data is transmitted across the web.

4. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: FFT is an algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse. It's extensively used in signal processing, image processing, and data analysis.

5. **Sorting Algorithms in Databases**: Algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and others are used in database management systems for sorting and efficiently retrieving data.

6. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Algorithms like neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines are fundamental to the field of machine learning and have wide applications from voice recognition to predictive analytics.

7. **GPS Routing Algorithms**: Algorithms used in GPS for finding the shortest or fastest route. Dijkstra's algorithm and A* are examples of algorithms used in GPS systems for navigation.

8. **Banking Algorithms**: Used for fraud detection, credit scoring, and risk management. These algorithms analyze transaction patterns to detect anomalies.

9. **Airline Scheduling Algorithms**: Airlines use complex algorithms for scheduling flights, crews, and gates, as well as for pricing tickets. These algorithms must consider numerous variables and constraints to optimize operations.

10. **Recommendation Systems**: Used by companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify, these algorithms analyze your past behavior to recommend products, movies, or music.

11. **Search Algorithms in E-commerce**: Algorithms that power the search functionality in e-commerce platforms, helping customers find the products they're looking for quickly.

12. **Compression Algorithms**: Like JPEG for images and MP3 for audio, these algorithms compress data to make it easier to store and transmit.

Each of these algorithms plays a crucial role in its respective domain, demonstrating the pervasive influence and importance of algorithmic thinking and problem-solving in the modern world.
