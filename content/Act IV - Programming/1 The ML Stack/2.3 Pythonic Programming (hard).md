##### Explain imports, packages and libraries

It's straightforward:
**Packages** = Folders
**Modules** = `.py` files 
**Objects** = classes, functions, or specific variables

<br>

```python
Package (directory/folder of Python files)
│
├── __init__.py (makes Python treat the directory as containing packages)
│
├── Module1 (a Python file .py)
│   ├── Class1 (a class in Module1)
│   │   ├── Function1 (a function in Class1)
│   │   └── Variable1 (a variable in Class1)
│   ├── Function2 (a function in Module1)
│   └── Variable2 (a variable in Module1)
│
├── Module2 (a Python file .py)
│   ├── Class2 (a class in Module2)
│   │   ├── Function3 (a function in Class2)
│   │   └── Variable3 (a variable in Class2)
│   ├── Function4 (a function in Module2)
│   └── Variable4 (a variable in Module2)
│
└── Subpackage (a directory of Python files within Package)
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── Submodule (a Python file .py within Subpackage)
    │   ├── Class3 (a class in Submodule)
    │   │   ├── Function5 (a function in Class3)
    │   │   └── Variable5 (a variable in Class3)
    │   ├── Function6 (a function in Submodule)
    │   └── Variable6 (a variable in Submodule)
    └── …
```

*(Note that there may be sub-packages)*

##### What actually happens when you call `my_list.sort()` in Python? 

> [!check]
> This is a glimpse into the **real** inner workings of, getting clsoer 
> 1. **Algorithm:** Python's `sort()` method uses an adaptive, stable, iterative mergesort algorithm known as Timsort. This algorithm is highly efficient for real-world data and maintains the relative order of equal elements (which is why it's called "stable").
> 2. **Efficiency:** Timsort is optimized for various scenarios, particularly for partially ordered lists or lists with many repeated elements. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case, but it performs better on partially sorted lists.

Don't take these magical functions for granted. 
We won't go more in detail into the core algorithms that operate at a lower level in this section - saving all of that for [[3.1 Intro|Data Structures and Algorithms]].

##### What is serializing?

> [!note]
> **Serializing** refers to translating a **data structure** or **object state** into a form that can be stored outside of the program, and then reconstructed later. 

If you haven't encountered the need to serialize yet, you probably haven't done enough machine learning. 

<br>
##### ↳ List some objects/data that you might need to serialize as a data scientist. 

1. **Trained Machine Learning Models**: Once you've trained a model, you need to save it for later use, whether for making predictions, further training, or analysis. Serialization allows you to store the model's state.
2. **Data Preprocessing Pipelines**: These include encoders, normalizers, and other transformers that you've fit to your data. Saving these ensures consistency in data preprocessing in future model use.
3. **Data Sets**: Particularly large datasets that have been cleaned and preprocessed might be serialized for efficient reloading in future sessions.
4. **Configuration Files**: Storing hyperparameters, environment settings, or experiment setups in a serialized format can help in replicability and documentation of your work.
5. **Custom Objects**: If you have built custom classes or functions in your data science workflow, serializing them can be useful for reusability across different projects or sharing with colleagues.

<br>
##### ↳ Imagine you've just spent 7 hours and lots of \$\$\$ training a model in your Jupyter Notebook, only to realise you never implemented serialization. What do you do?

`>>> OUTPUT: Model successfully trained`

If I realized that I forgot to serialize a model after training, I would take the following steps:

**Check if the Model is Still in Memory**
1. **Interactive Python Environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python Shell)**:
    - If I ran my code in an interactive environment where the Python session is still active, the model might still be in memory. In this case, I could directly serialize the model by executing the serialization code (using `pickle`, `joblib`, or another method) in the same session.

```python
import pickle

# Assuming my_model is your model variable
with open('model_filename.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(my_model, file)
```

2. **Command Line or Non-Interactive Environment**:
    - If I ran the script via the command line or a non-interactive environment (like executing a `.py` file), and the script has finished running, the Python process would terminate, and all variables (including my model) are cleared from memory. 
    - In this case, unfortunately, there's **no way** to serialize the model post hoc. The model would need to be retrained.

**This is a costly mistake, but it emphasizes the importance of integrating serialization into the workflow.**

##### What is a `float64`

```python
#   Column          Non-Null Count   Dtype 
--- ------          --------------   ----- 
0   fixed acidity   1599 non-null    float64
```

Used to represent **real numbers** (numbers with whole and decimal parts), using **64** bits.

`brightness = max(min(brightness, 1), 0)`

##### What does the `@` do in Python?

It denotes a **decorator function.** 

> [!check] Decorator
> A decorator is a special type of function that can modify the behavior of a function or a method. Decorators provide a way to alter or extend the behavior of the function or method they are attached to, without permanently modifying it.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

##### ↳ What about when they are use within classes? E.g what does `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` mean?

> [!check] Class method
> - A method that is bound to the **class** rather than its **instances**. 
> - Class methods can access and modify the class state that applies across all instances of the class.
> - They are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator, and they take `cls` as the first parameter, which represents the class itself.

> [!check] Static method
> - A static method in Python is a method that belongs to a class but does not require an instance of the class to be called
> - Static methods cannot change the class or instance state.
> - They are typically used for utility functions that perform a task in isolation.
> - They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator, and they do not require a `self` parameter unlike most methods.

##### Practice question: Lightbulb Class

```python
class LightBulb:
    eco_mode = False  # Class-wide setting

    def __init__(self):
        # The state of the bulb depends on whether eco_mode is enabled
        self.is_on = not LightBulb.eco_mode

    def toggle(self):
        self.is_on = not self.is_on

```

##### ↳ Write a class method `toggle_eco_mode` that switches the eco_mode for all instances of `LightBulb`

```python
	# ...
	
	@classmethod
	def toggle_eco_mode(cls):
		cls.eco_mode = not cls.eco_mode
```

##### ↳ Now switch the eco mode across all bulbs and then create a LightBulb

```python
LightBulb.toggle_eco_mode()
bulb1 = LightBulb()
print(f"Bulb1 is on: {bulb1.is_on}")
```

##### Can sets contain lists in Python? If not, why? 

☞ No, sets in Python cannot include lists as elements. 

☞ This restriction is due to the fact that sets can only contain immutable (unchangeable) types, and lists are mutable (changeable). 

☞ Since lists can be modified after their creation, they cannot be hashed, which is a requirement for elements of a set.
