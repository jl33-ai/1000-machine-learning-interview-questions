what does '`git push origin main`' mean explain each word

1. **`git`**:
   - This is the command line tool for working with Git, a distributed version control system. 
   - It's the main command that starts off any Git operation.

2. **`push`**:
   - This is a Git subcommand. The `push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. It transfers commits from your local repository to the remote repository.

from:
3. **`origin`**:
   - This specifies the name of the remote repository where you're pushing your changes. By default, when you clone a repository, Git automatically names this remote repository `origin`. This is essentially a shorthand or an alias for the URL of the remote repository.

to: 
4. **`main`**:
   - This is the name of the branch you are pushing to on the remote repository. In this case, `main` is likely the default branch of the repository. It's the branch where your final, stable code lives. In older repositories or in certain contexts, this branch might be called `master`.
