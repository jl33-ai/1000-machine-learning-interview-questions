###### 3.1) The Exponential Distribution

Picture this: you're relaxing on the balcony of your penthouse on a brisk summer evening ✻. If you know that an average of **3 planes** fly past your balcony **per hour**, and one plane just flew past, what is the expected amount of time you'll have wait until you see the next one? In fact - how can you model the wait time between successive planes in general? 

<p align='right'><i>✻ The data science grind paid off.</i></p>

<br>

The exponential distribution models the time between occurrences of successive events in a **Poisson process**. Its PMF is:
$$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$
- $\lambda$ is the **rate parameter** 
	- It represents "how many events occur **per unit time** on average"
	- I.e $\text{3 planes per (one) hour}$
	- Note that it is the inverse of the **mean**...
- $\mu$ is the mean parameter
	- Simply the inverse; $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ 
	- It represents "how long **between events** on average"
	- I.e the **1/3 hours between each plane on average, or one plane every 20 minutes**

- $E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda}$
- Variance = $\frac{1}{\lambda^2}$

###### Q3.2) Example: Call Centre
*A customer support centre for a popular software application experiences an average of 2 calls every hour. Assuming the time between calls follows an exponential distribution, what is the probability that the next call will occur within the next 15 minutes? Also, what is the expected waiting time until the next call?*

$Pr(X < \frac{1}{4}) = 0.393$

$E(X) =$ 30 minutes

###### Q3.3) What is a special property of the exponential distribution? Could you use an example to explain?  

> ☞ A distribution is memoryless if the probability of an event occurring in the future is not affected by how much time has already passed. 


**The Math**
$$P(T>s+t∣T>s)=P(T>t)$$
$T$ = the wait time
**In english:** The probability that it will take at least another t minutes to see the first event (RHS) is the same given that s minutes has already passed (LHS). 

**Real world example:** 
If you've been waiting for a bus for 10 minutes, the probability that you'll have to wait an additional 5 minutes is the same as if you just arrived at the bus stop.
