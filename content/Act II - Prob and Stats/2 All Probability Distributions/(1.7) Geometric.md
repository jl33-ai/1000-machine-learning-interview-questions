###### After how many trials can I expect my first success?
`Geometric`

The geometric distribution models the number of Bernoulli trials needed for the first success. Its PMF is:
\[ P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p \]
Where:
- \( p \) is the probability of success on each trial.
- Expected value (mean) = \( \frac{1}{p} \)
- Variance = \( \frac{1-p}{p^2} \)

###### Q4) **How many trials are needed to achieve the r-th success?**
`Negative Binomial`

The negative binomial distribution models the number of trials needed to achieve a fixed number of successes. Its PMF is:
\[ P(X=k) = \binom{k-1}{r-1} p^r (1-p)^{k-r} \]
Where:
- \( r \) is the desired number of successes.
- \( p \) is the probability of success on each trial.
- Expected value (mean) = \( \frac{r}{p} \)
- Variance = \( \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2} \)
