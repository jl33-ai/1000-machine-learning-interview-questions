###### Q6) **A company produces candies in three colors: red, blue, and green. From past data, it's known that 40% of candies are red, 30% are blue, and 30% are green. If you randomly select 10 candies from a large bin, what is the probability that you get 4 red candies, 3 blue candies, and 3 green candies?**

> ☞ The multinomial distribution is a **generalization** of the binomial, i.e instead of only telling you the probability of seeing $x$ successes **(where the only other outcome is failure)** it tells you the probabilities of observing counts among **multiple** categories.
> ☞ Therefore, the binomial distribution is just a **special case** of the multinomial distribution, where the only 2 categories are success/fail.

**Parameters:**
- $n$: the number of trials
- $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ : the probabilities of each $k$ outcomes (i.e for a dice roll, each $p_{1..6}$ should be $\frac{1}{6}$)

**Probability Mass Function (PMF):**
The probability of observing a particular set of outcomes is given by:

$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, ... , X_k = x_k) = \frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!...x_k!} p_1^{x_1} p_2^{x_2} ... p_k^{x_k}$$

Where:
- \( X_i \) is the number of trials that result in outcome \( i \)
- \( x_i \) is a specific number of successes for outcome \( i \) in \( n \) trials

**Returning to our candy example:**

Here, \( n = 10 \) (as you pick 10 candies), \( p_{red} = 0.4 \), \( p_{blue} = 0.3 \), and \( p_{green} = 0.3 \). 
You want \( x_{red} = 4 \), \( x_{blue} = 3 \), and \( x_{green} = 3 \).

Plugging the values into the PMF:

\[ P(X_{red} = 4, X_{blue} = 3, X_{green} = 3) \]
\[ = \frac{10!}{4!3!3!} \times 0.4^4 \times 0.3^3 \times 0.3^3 \]

Evaluating this gives you the desired probability.

By understanding and using the multinomial distribution, you can determine the likelihood of specific combinations of outcomes for multi-category experiments, and should really give you a better grasp of the binomial distribution.
