Just another way to model something that [[(1.1) Intro to Probability Distributions#^df8402|happens in the real world]]. 

This time, instead of modelling a coin toss in order to understand the behaviour of the outcome: heads or tails. 

We model some stochastic process where events occur randomly in time, like **customers arriving at a store**. By modelling it as a **Poisson process**, we unlock the ability to know **exactly** about: 
- The number of events that will happen in a window of time ~ [Poisson]
- The time we will have to wait to see the first or next event ~ [Exponential]
- The time we will have to wait to see the `nth` event ~ [Gamma]

By making some assumptions about this process, we can model it in an extremely useful way. 

This gives birth to some distributions which describe different aspects of this process. 

Simply put; it's anything where events occur at some average rate. 
###### What is a Poisson Process?

`Stop! ⚠️` *Before we go further, we must understand the Poisson Process **well** - it's super important, as many of the following distributions all describe different parts of a poisson process - **not** just the Poisson distribution!*

A Poisson process is a type of stochastic process where events occur randomly in time. It is characterized by the following properties:

1. The number of events in non-overlapping intervals is independent.
2. The probability of more than one event happening in an infinitesimally small interval is essentially zero.
3. The probability of exactly one event in the infinitesimally small time interval \( dt \) is approximately $\lambda dt$, where $\lambda$ is the rate of the process.
