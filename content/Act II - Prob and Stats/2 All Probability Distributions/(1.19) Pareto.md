###### Q1) **How do we model distributions that represent the wealth or income of populations?**
`Pareto`

The Pareto distribution is used to model distributions that have a "heavy tail", often found in wealth or income distributions. Its parameters are:
- Scale parameter \( x_m \)
- Shape parameter \( \alpha \)
- Expected value (mean) (for \( \alpha > 1 \)) = \( \frac{\alpha x_m}{\alpha-1} \)
- Variance (for \( \alpha > 2 \)) = \( \frac{x_m^2\alpha}{(\alpha-1)^2(\alpha-2)} \)
