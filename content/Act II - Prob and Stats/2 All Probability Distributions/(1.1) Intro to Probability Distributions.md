# Modelling the Real World

^df8402

All models - financial models, weather models, machine learning models, make some assumptions/simplifications in ***order to unlock*** powerful analytical and predictive insights regarding the thing being modelled. 

Heuristically, data science and modelling is all about **simplifying** the **real world** into some **mathematical model**. 

For example, linear regression **models** the relationship between two variables by saying that one is just a linear function of the other, plus or minus a little bit of **random error**. 

Probability is complicated, but it is just another tool used to simplify the much, much more complex **real world**.  

Just think about how complex the real world actually is. 

**Take the innocent coin toss for example**

What factors ***actually*** go into the outcome of that coin toss? 

- The release angle
	- The release velocity
		- Any air current 
			- The weight of the coin
				- The friction of the coin's surface
					- The material it falls on 
						- Some quantum physics, probably? 
							- ...

***Instead***, we simply package all of this randomness and cause-effect into a single, neat **Bernoulli random variable**, and simply say it is **heads** with probability `0.5`, and **tails** with probability `0.5`.

It is one of many ways to model some real-world event. 
- Bernoulli trial
- Poisson process
