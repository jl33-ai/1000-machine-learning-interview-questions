###### How many different ways can you order 5 rocks?
> ⚘ This is how a **permutation** arises.

$5!=120$

<br>

###### How many different orderings of 3 items can you choose from 5 (order matters)?

> ⚘ This is also a **permutation**, but a more general case. 

Use $$\text{no. permutations}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$
Where 
- $n=$ the total number of items 
- $k=$ the number of items being selected

###### ↳ Great. Can you re-answer the previous question using this formula? 

☞ Use $n=5, k=5$

<br>
###### ↳ I have 2 blue balls, 3 green balls, and 4 red balls. How many different ways are there to order them such that each permutation has a unique sequence of colours (the balls are otherwise identical)

> ⚘ This is known as the number of permutations of a **multiset** (ordinary sets can only have one of each 'type', **multisets** are defined as in this question). 
> 
> Total permutations = $\frac{(n)!}{n_1! \times n_2! \times \ldots \times n_k!}$
> Where $n$ is the total number of items in the **multiset** and $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ are the numbers of identical items in each of the $k$ different categories within the **multiset**.

So there are $\frac{9!}{2! \times 3! \times 4!}$ different ways that the balls can be arranged.

###### How many different ways can you select 3 cars from 8?
> ⚘ This is how a **combination** arises. It involves the `choose` function, a handy formula which tells you the number of different ways you can select $k$ items from $n$ total items.

###### If you have 9 switches that can be either `on` or `off`, how many different combinations can you have?
> ⚘ This is a combination of **binary choices**. The formula is very intuitive.

☞ There are $9$ switches
☞ Each switch can either be `on` or `off` ($2$ choices)
☞ $2 * 2 * 2 *\dots$
☞ $2^9$ total combinations

###### How many ways can 4 people get their hats back such that no one gets their own hat?
> ⚘ This is a classic example of a **derangement**. These are **permutations** where no element appears in its original position.

The formula for the number of derangements of $n$ distinct items, denoted as $!n$, is given by:

$!n = n! \left( \frac{1}{0!} - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + ... + \frac{(-1)^n}{n!} \right)$

For 4 people (or 4 hats), the formula becomes:

$!4 = 4! \left( \frac{1}{0!} - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{4!} \right)$

The number of ways 4 people can get their hats back such that no one gets their own hat (a derangement) is exactly 9. This result is obtained by applying the formula for derangements to 4 items.

6+3=9 ways

<br>

###### ↳ How many ways result in only 1 person getting their original hat back? 
> ⚘ To answer this, we need to extend the formula for a derangement to this: 
> ${n\choose k} \cdot !(n-k)$
> 


<br>

###### ↳ How many ways result in exactly 2 people getting their original hat back? 

<br>

###### ↳ How many ways result in exactly 3 people getting their original hat back? 

If 3 people have their original hat, so **must** the 4th person. Therefore, there are 0 ways which result in this. 
<br>

###### ↳ How many ways result in all 4 people getting their original hat back? 

There is clearly only **1 assignment** in which they all get their respective hats back. 

<br>

###### ↳ Can you convert these all into probabilities? 

They are all disjoint and mutually exclusive events, so simply divide by the total number of possible permutations/assignments, $4! = 24$. 

**E.g** $Pr = \frac{9}{24}$

###### ↳ Now imagine the general case of $n$ people and $n$ hats. What is the probability that any particular person gets their original hat back? 

$1/n$ - **by symmetry**, they have an equal probability of getting any one of the $n$ hats back, so there is a $1/n$ chance that it is their original one. 

☞ How do you know the apply **symmetry?** Well, would there be any reason for it to be more or less likely to receive any specific hat? No.
∴ There must be uniform probability of receiving any given hat. 

<br>

###### ↳ Use this fact, and linearity of expectation, in order to calculate the expected number of people who get their original hat back, out of $n$ people. 

☞ First, let $X_i$ be the indicator random variable that person $i$ gets their original hat back. 

	☞ I.e, if they got their original hat back, $X=1$, otherwise $X=0$.
	
☞ Then the total number of people who get their original hat back is $Y = X_1 + \dots + X_n$

☞ Use linearity of expectation: $\mathbb{E}(Y) = \mathbb{E}(X_1) + \dots + \mathbb{E}(X_n)$
∴ **On average**, only 1 person gets their hat back - no matter the value of $n$.

###### How many ways can you distribute 10 books to 3 students so that the first student gets 5 books, the second student gets 3 books, and the third student gets 2 books?

> ⚘ An extension of the **Combination Formula**: The number of ways to choose k items from n items is given by $\binom{n}{k}$.

☞ For the first student, choose 5 books from 10: $\binom{10}{5}$.

☞ For the second student, choose 3 books from the remaining 5: $\binom{5}{3}$.

☞ The third student gets the remaining 2 books, which is a single combination: $\binom{2}{2}$.

☞ Calculate the total ways by multiplying these combinations...
∴ **Total ways** = $\binom{10}{5} \times \binom{5}{3} \times \binom{2}{2} = 2520$

Thus, there are 2,520 different ways to distribute the books among the three students as per the given criteria.

<br>

###### ↳ Translate this into a probability of this event occurring.

☞ To find the probability of this specific distribution happening by chance...
**Probability** = $\frac{\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Outcomes}} = \frac{2520}{3^{10}}$

###### Q6) **How many successes can I expect when drawing a sample without replacement from a population?**
> ⚘ This is an application of the **Hypergeometric Distribution**

The **hypergeometric distribution** models the number of successes in a sample drawn without replacement from a population. Its PMF is:
$$P(X=k) = \frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$
Where:
- \( N \) is the total population size.
- \( K \) is the number of success states in the population.
- \( n \) is the number of draws.
- Expected value (mean) = \( n \frac{K}{N} \)
- Variance = \( n \frac{K}{N} \frac{N-K}{N} \frac{N-n}{N-1} \)

###### Q7) **If I choose $5$ cards from a deck of $52$ cards (without replacement), what is the probability that $x=3$ of them are red?**
`Hint: Hypergeometric Distribution`

Answer: $Pr(X=3) \approx 0.325$

> ☞ The **hypergeometric distribution** deals with the distribution of the number of successes and failures when drawing from a finite population **without replacement**

**Hypergeometric Distribution Parameters:**
1. $N$: Total number of items in the population.
2. $K$: Total number of success items in the population.
3. $n$: Number of items drawn without replacement
4. $k$: Number of observed successes.

The probability of drawing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ draws from the population is given by:
$$P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$
- Mean: $E(X) = n \frac{K}{N}$
- Variance: $Var(X) = n \frac{K}{N} \frac{N-K}{N} \frac{N-n}{N-1}$

**Explanation:**

1. $\binom{K}{k}$: This gives us the number of ways to choose \(k\) successes from the \(K\) successes available in the population.
2. $\binom{N-K}{n-k}$: This represents the number of ways to choose the remaining $n-k$ failures from the $N-K$ failures in the population.
3. $\binom{N}{n}$: This is the total number of ways to choose any $n$ items from the $N$ items in the population.

The fraction $\frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}$ computes the proportion of ways to get $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures out of all possible ways to draw $n$ items. This proportion gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ draws.

*The beauty of this formula is that it accounts for all possible combinations of successes and failures one might get when drawing from the population.*

**Note that this is not the same thing as a Binomial Distribution with $n=5, p=0.5$ because you are sampling without replacement, instead of treating each card as an independent Bernoulli trial with constant probability of success. 

Revisiting the question: 

[write out the calculations labelling the logic]
