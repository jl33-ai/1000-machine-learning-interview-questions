###### Q4) **How do we model the distribution of a variable whose logarithm is normally distributed?**
`Lognormal`

The lognormal distribution models a variable whose logarithm follows a normal distribution. If \( X \) is lognormally distributed, then \( Y = \ln(X) \) is normally distributed. Parameters are:
- \( \mu \) and \( \sigma^2 \) which are the mean and variance of the variable's natural logarithm.
- Expected value (mean) = \( e^{\mu + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}} \)
- Variance = \( (e^{\sigma^2} - 1)e^{2\mu+\sigma^2} \)
