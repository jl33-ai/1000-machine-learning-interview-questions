###### Q2.1) **LeBron is a basketball player with a shooting percentage of 70%. If he attempts 20 shots, what is the probability that he makes at least 15?**
`Binomial`

The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of Bernoulli trials. Its PMF is:
$$P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$
Where:
- $n$ is the number of trials.
- $p$ is the probability of success on each trial.
- Expected value (mean) = \( np \)
- Variance = \( np(1-p) \)

> â˜ž If you repeat something $n$ times, and each time there is a probability $p$ of success, the binomial distribution tells you exactly **how likely it is to see each number of successes**. 

###### Q2.2) **Follow up: this experiment is an example of a sequence of which type of trials? What is an important assumption that we have made about these trials?**

A sequence of Bernoulli trials, which must be **independent** of each other. 
Another assumption we have implicitly made it that each attempt is **identically distributed**. 

###### Q2.3) **Follow up: Comment on the validity of this assumption.**


###### Q2.4) **Follow up: For a binomial hypothesis test, why is the $\alpha$ of the test at $p=0.4$ equal to the $\beta$ of the test at $p=0.6$.**
