###### In plain english, summarise the relationship between the exponential, poisson, and gamma distributions

 The poisson tells you how many in a certain amount of time. The exponential tells you how long till the first. The gamma tells you how long till the kth.

| Distribution          | Can be Special Case Of        | Conditions or Parameters                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Exponential           | Gamma                  | Shape parameter of 1                                                     |
| Poisson               | Binomial               | Number of trials → ∞, probability of success → 0, product remains constant|
| Bernoulli             | Binomial               | Number of trials is 1                                                    |
| Normal                | Binomial               | Large number of trials, probability of success not close to 0 or 1       |
| Normal                | Poisson                | Mean → ∞                                                                |
| Geometric             | Negative Binomial      | Number of successes is 1                                                 |
| Chi-Square            | Gamma                  | Shape parameter is \( k/2 \), scale parameter is 2                       |
| Erlang                | Gamma                  | Shape parameter is an integer                                            |
| Uniform               | Beta                   | Both parameters equal to 1                                               |
| Standard Normal       | Normal                 | Mean of 0, standard deviation of 1                                       |
| Rectangular (Uniform) | Triangular             | Mode (peak) is anywhere between the minimum and maximum values           |
| Log-Normal            | - (Related to Normal)  | Natural logarithm of the variable is normally distributed                |
