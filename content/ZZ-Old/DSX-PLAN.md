`please Write some good interview questions surrounding logistic regression (for a machine learning engineer role)`

---

mock interviews, behavioural prep, brushing up on your projects so you know what to talk about haha, but if you're going for the canva ML role then i'd advise:

- going over basic training stuff, so train test split, how would you combat under-represented classes
- potential ai bias stuff
- a read on recommender systems

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. It is now one of the most popular languages in the world. It is routinely used by system administrators and web developers. Also, many scientists are using Python thanks to libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and matplotlib. The ease of use of Python and its dynamic nature make it a very productive language.  
  
[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is an interactive command-line terminal for Python. It was created by Fernando Perez in 2001. IPython offers an enhanced read-eval-print loop (REPL) environment particularly well adapted to scientific computing.

  

DSX: inplace meaning - simple. Change in place, or return the new, changed DF

make all bolded words red and highlted words rainbow. 
Not TDLR but **MORAL: **

QUESTION IDEAS: 
- data analysis
	- Observational Study vs Experiment 
	- representativeness. 
- reading comprehension test (read the sentence then answer the questions, affinda style)
- if you missed the double 'the' you need more attention detail. 
- Lost quote 
- What is a guard. FUCK I WISH I TRIED IN FOA
- Test python errors: you BETTER learn this shit urself
- Maximising the log-likelihood doesn't always have to involving setting the derivative = 0, just look at it and figure out what maximises it. 
- question 7, 2017 stats exam is neat. 
- Simpson Paradox; in a way you're comparing two different treatments
	- instead of 'most effective for kidney stones' should be 'most effective for small ones, most effective for large ones' or it should be a **weighted average**
	- Relationship between X and Y confounded by Z. 
- How could you use user based reinforcement learning to sublty train your model - chat GPT thumbs up thumbs down. Talk through an actual implementation. 
- What is the minimax algorithm. 
- **observed** vs **RANDOM**
- explain the statement 'more info = more power' (In a statistical sense, dummy)
	- power is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ given that it is actually false. When a statistical test uses more 'information' present in the sample, it has higher power, meaning essentially that it is more likely to be reject when it **supposed to**. 
- What is BI, Data Warehousing, Star Schema, Dimensions... 
- Question 4 and 5 from week 2 stats... good. and q9 
- A question that goes through Simpson's paradox and sampling bias
- A question that goes through all types of Bias' with sick examples 
- Observational study vs Experiment w/ marshmallow experiment, and ram's nut times. 
- Function notation $\overset{the reals}{R}$
- How do you think Spotify's 'Song Radio' feature works. 
- Quick! what's seventy one times forty one? 
- Machine learning: class of blah blah for problems that cannot be explicitly programmed into a machine - i.e handwritten digits. leetcode 22 tho..  
- Problem solving
	- Counter example 
	- Simplest case - Robert
	- Root cause analysis 
	- ... 
- https://youtu.be/CFkhUajb8c8?si=fuBS8q8Cbkjkcm4p Explain the fundamental steps in creating a Chess AI. I want you to create a simple chess AI. explain the steps you would take. 
- - Using more information gives it more power given the additional assumptions are met
- Really good hypothetical question game such as 
	- 'How would company X go about (predicting/measuring/aggregating) Y'
	- E.g how do you think Spotify does the blend playlist thing 
	- How do you think Google decides which pages to show (10 blue links)

Marshmallow expeirment: 
> Certainly! The "Marshmallow Experiment" was a series of studies on delayed gratification conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s by psychologist Walter Mischel. In the experiment, young children were placed in a room with a single marshmallow and given a choice: they could eat the marshmallow immediately or wait for about 15 minutes without eating it, in which case they would be rewarded with a second marshmallow. The aim was to measure the children's ability to delay gratification. Follow-up studies found that children who were able to wait longer for the greater reward tended to have better life outcomes in areas like education and health. The experiment highlights the significance of self-control and its potential long-term implications.

Case in point. I lvoe reading this shit - very grateful.

1. Sure, read this book, but: it needs to be in **your** 🧠
2. explain selflessly - explain it in such a way that people will realise/'get' things for the first time reading this book, not ignorant, only as much information as they need. Just tell it intelligetnyl, easily, makes sense
3. This is not the place to learn these concepts - if you encounter something new, I will link to sources to learn the concept if you don't already know it.

   - A variation of ReLU to allow small negative values.

6. **Softmax Function:**
   - Used in multi-class classification problems to convert raw scores into probabilities for each class.

7. **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) Function:**
   - A variation of ReLU that allows negative values and smoothens the curve for negative inputs.

8. **Logarithm Function:**
   - Equation: \(f(x) = \log_b(x)\) where \(b\) is the base.
   - Used in algorithms like logistic regression and in loss functions like log loss.

9. **Step Function:**
   - Outputs 0 for all inputs less than a threshold and 1 for all inputs greater than or equal to the threshold.
   - Used in models like the perceptron.

10. **Swish Function:**
   - Equation: \(f(x) = x \times \sigma(\beta x)\) where \(\sigma\) is the sigmoid function.

**Interviewer**: Good morning! Before we dive deep, can you let me know if you're familiar with both SQL and NoSQL databases?

**Interviewee**: Good morning! Yes, I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

**Interviewer**: Great! Can you briefly describe the primary differences between the two?

**Interviewee**: Absolutely. SQL databases are relational databases that store data in a structured format using rows and columns, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and can manage unstructured or semi-structured data. SQL databases have a fixed schema, whereas NoSQL databases are typically schema-less, allowing for more flexibility in data entry. SQL databases generally scale vertically, while NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling.

**Interviewer**: Interesting. Can you give an example of when you might choose a NoSQL database over an SQL database?

**Interviewee**: Certainly. If I were building a content management system where the data structures needed to be flexible and could change based on user needs or if I was dealing with a system that required massive amounts of data and quick scalability, I'd lean towards NoSQL. A good example might be a social media platform where user-generated content doesn't conform to a fixed schema and the platform needs to scale horizontally with growing user base.

**Interviewer**: Makes sense. How about ACID and CAP? Can you explain their relevance to these databases?

**Interviewee**: Sure! SQL databases typically adhere to the ACID properties, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. This ensures high data integrity and consistency. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are often guided by the CAP theorem which emphasizes Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. Depending on the specific NoSQL database, you might have to make trade-offs between consistency and availability.

**Interviewer**: Very well put. Lastly, can you name a few databases from each category?

**Interviewee**: Certainly! For SQL, examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database. For NoSQL, there are MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (column-oriented), and Neo4j (graph-based).

**Interviewer**: Fantastic! Thank you for the detailed explanations. Let's move on to the next topic.

The relationship between the gamma distribution and the sum of independent exponentials is a classic example of how one distribution arises from the combination of others. Here are a few other distributions with similar relationships:

1. **Normal Distribution**:
    - The sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables (by the Central Limit Theorem) tends to a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables, provided they have finite means and variances.
  
2. **Chi-Squared Distribution**:
    - If \(Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_k\) are independent standard normal random variables (mean 0, variance 1), then the sum of their squares, \(Q = Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + \ldots + Z_k^2\), is distributed according to the chi-squared distribution with \(k\) degrees of freedom. This is a special case of the gamma distribution.

3. **t-Distribution**:
    - If \(Z\) is a standard normal random variable and \(V\) is an independent chi-squared random variable with \(k\) degrees of freedom, then the random variable \(T = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{V/k}}\) has a t-distribution with \(k\) degrees of freedom.

4. **F-Distribution**:
    - If \(V_1\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(d_1\) degrees of freedom and \(V_2\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(d_2\) degrees of freedom, and \(V_1\) and \(V_2\) are independent, then the ratio \(F = \frac{V_1/d_1}{V_2/d_2}\) has an F-distribution with \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) degrees of freedom.

5. **Beta Distribution**:
    - The beta distribution can be related to the order statistics of the uniform distribution. If \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) are independent random variables that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, then the random variable \(X = \frac{U_1}{U_1 + U_2}\) has a beta distribution.

6. **Poisson Distribution**:
    - The sum of independent Poisson random variables with parameters \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_k \) is another Poisson random variable with parameter \( \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \ldots + \lambda_k \).

7. **Exponential Distribution**:
    - The minimum of several independent exponential random variables (each with possibly different rates) is also exponentially distributed, but with a rate that is the sum of the individual rates.

These relationships are crucial in statistical theory and practice because they allow statisticians and researchers to understand the behavior of combined random processes and to derive properties of new distributions from properties of familiar ones.



# DB: Should know all of these. 
There are several other data models apart from the relational data model. Each data model represents data in a specific way and is suited to different types of applications and use cases. Here are some other data models:

1. **Hierarchical Data Model:** This model organizes data into a tree-like structure with a single root, where each record has a parent and zero or more children. It was popular in early database systems like IBM's IMS.

2. **Network Data Model:** Similar to the hierarchical model, but it allows for more flexible relationships. Records can have multiple parents, forming a network of relationships. The CODASYL database model is an example of this.

3. **Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model):** This model represents data as entities, attributes, and the relationships between entities. It's widely used in database design to create a visual representation of the data structure.

4. **Object-Oriented Data Model:** This model extends the concepts of object-oriented programming to databases. It treats data as objects with attributes and methods and supports inheritance and encapsulation.

5. **Object-Relational Data Model (ORDBMS):** This model combines elements of both relational and object-oriented databases. It adds support for complex data types and methods while retaining the tabular structure of relational databases.

6. **Document Data Model:** Document databases, like MongoDB, use this model. Data is stored in flexible, semi-structured documents (e.g., JSON or XML) instead of tables. It's suitable for applications with varying or evolving data structures.

7. **Key-Value Data Model:** In this model, data is stored as key-value pairs. It's highly efficient for simple read and write operations but less suitable for complex queries.

8. **Columnar Data Model:** Columnar databases store data in columns rather than rows, which can be more efficient for analytical queries. Examples include Apache Cassandra and Google Bigtable.

9. **Graph Data Model:** Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j) use this model to represent data as nodes and edges. It's ideal for data with complex relationships, such as social networks and recommendation systems.

10. **Time-Series Data Model:** This model is designed for handling data that is generated and collected over time. Time-series databases (e.g., InfluxDB) are optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data.

11. **Spatial Data Model:** Spatial databases are used to store and query geographic and geometric data. They support spatial data types and operations for applications like GIS (Geographic Information Systems).

12. **Multidimensional Data Model:** Used in data warehousing and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems, this model organizes data into multi-dimensional cubes to facilitate complex analytical queries.

13. **Semistructured Data Model:** This model accommodates data that doesn't fit neatly into traditional structured models. Examples include XML databases and JSON databases.

14. **Knowledge Graph Data Model:** This model represents data as a graph of interconnected concepts, entities, and relationships. It's used for building knowledge graphs and semantic web applications.

These are some of the main data models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of data model depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data and the application being developed.
